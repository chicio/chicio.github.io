*I recently discovered MockK, a mocking library created for Kotlin. Let's see how it is possible to write modern unit tests with MockK + JUnit 5.*

---

As I told you in my [last post](/2020/12/23/rest-template-webclient-spring-boot.html), in the last months during my daily job I wrote a lot of Kotlin backend code during my daily job. Usually I develop new stuff using Test Driven Development (TDD) technique. Specifically, most of the time I use the [mockist approach](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html#ClassicalAndMockistTesting). This basically means that I need a mock library. For Java there are JMock and Mockito, and in fact I usually use Mockito. It is possible to use this library with Kotlin but [it has some limitations](https://antonioleiva.com/mockito-2-kotlin/). So I started to wonder if there was an alternative, and I found that in [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ "lastminute.com group") we were already using MockK, a mocking library "written in Kotlin for Kotlin" :smirk:. In this post I will show you how to use MockK and JUnit 5 to improve you unit tests. To do this, I will migrate to Kotlin + MockK + JUnit 5 an old kata I did some time ago in Java + Mockito: the Minesweeper. So let's start!!

#### Implementation

Let's start from the installation. For this kata I use [maven](https://maven.apache.org "maven") to manage my dependecies. To install JUnit 5 I use the JUnit 5 [Bill of materials](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-maven-bom "bom"), usually abbreviated to BOM. If you don't know what a BOM is, you can find the definition below (keep in my that also that BOM is a general concept and you can find it also in other build system like for example Gradle).

> BOM is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a projectâ€™s dependencies and provide a central place to define and update those versions. BOM provides the flexibility to add a dependency to our module without worrying about the version that we should depend on. 

The installation of MockK is easier. The only thing I need to do is just to add the dependecy to the pom file. Last but not list  Below you can find the entire pom file.

The migration to Kotlin of the project was easy with IntelliJ IDEA: I just launched the automatic conversion that you can find in the menu `Code -> Convert Java File to Kotlin File` and that fixed the code obtained. In particular, given the fact that there weren't [nullability annotations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html "java nullability annotations"), all the fields of all the classes were created as Optional.  
After the converions I started to rewrite all the tests. Let's start to see the `FieldTest`, a test without mocking where I just needed to migrate from JUnit 5. In this test suite you can find some tests for the `neighboursOf` method of the `Field` class. This method returns a list containing the cell statuses for the neighbours of a cell received as parameter (identified by its row and column position). The Java version of this test was just a list of method with the `@Test` annotation. Anyway in [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) there are some annotations that can help to give better names and to group better the tests:

* `@DisplayName("< New Name>")`, an annotation used to declare a custom display name for the annotated test class or test method. These names are typically used for test reporting in IDEs and build tools and may contain spaces, special characters, and even emoji.
* `@Nested`, an annotation used to signal that a class is a nested, non-static test class (i.e., an inner class) that can share setup and state with an instance of its enclosing class.

In addition to these annotations, it is possible to use some Kotlin features:

* backticks to define test method (again, you can use this feature only for tests, not in your production code).
* expression expression, a feature that let you avoid writing curly brackets if you method body contains just one line of code.

Last but not least, I also switched fromt he `assertThat` method and its matchers to `assertEquals` method, that is more developer friendly in terms of error messages when your test fails. Below you can find the final result.

```kotlin
package it.chicio.minesweeper

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals
import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

@DisplayName("Field")
class FieldTest {
    @Nested
    @DisplayName("neighbours for")
    inner class NeighboursTest {
        @Test
        fun `1x1 field`() =
                assertEquals(FieldFactory().make(arrayOf(arrayOf("*"))).neighboursOf(0, 0), emptyList<String>())

        @Test
        fun `1x2 on left`() =
                assertEquals(FieldFactory().make(arrayOf(arrayOf("*", "."))).neighboursOf(0, 1), listOf("*"))

        @Test
        fun `2x1 on right`() =
                assertEquals(FieldFactory().make(arrayOf(arrayOf(".", "*"))).neighboursOf(0, 0),listOf("*"))

        @Test
        fun `2x2 on right`() =
                assertEquals(
                        FieldFactory()
                                .make(arrayOf(arrayOf(".", "*"), arrayOf("*", "*")))
                                .neighboursOf(0, 0),
                        listOf("*", "*", "*")
                )

        @Test
        fun `2x3 on right and left`() =
                assertEquals(
                        FieldFactory()
                                .make(arrayOf(arrayOf("*", ".", "*"), arrayOf("*", "*", "*")))
                                .neighboursOf(0, 1),
                        listOf("*", "*", "*", "*", "*")
                )

        @Test
        fun `3x3 with 3 bombs`() = assertEquals(
                FieldFactory()
                        .make(arrayOf(arrayOf("*", "*", "*"), arrayOf("*", ".", "*"), arrayOf("*", "*", "*")))
                        .neighboursOf(1, 1), listOf("*", "*", "*", "*", "*", "*", "*", "*")
        )
    }
}
```

Cool, isn't it :sunglasses:? If I run this test in IntelliJ IDEA I can see a much more clear feedback about my test results (It seems almost a list of [BDD behavioural tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)). If you ever tried to develop something with Jest on the frontend side of the web development world, you will feel at home.

Let's move to a new test to see MockK in action. `FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThemTest` seems a good example of a test where I can show the basic building blocks MockK.  
The first thing I have to do is to create the mocks needed by the class under test. In contrast to the Runner, TestRule, and MethodRule extension hooks in JUnit 4, the JUnit 5 extension model consists of a single concept: the Extension API. Extensions are related to an event in the execution of a test that are called extension point. JUnit 5 engine will trigger the registered extensions for each specific extension point. There are a lot of extension points available. You can find the complete list in the [Junit 5 doc](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions "junit 5 extensions"). As you can image MockK lets you initialize your mock with an Extension called `MockKExtension` (if you find more details, this is a [TestInstancePostProcessor](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-test-instance-post-processing "TestInstancePostProcessor") and [ParameterResolver](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-parameter-resolution) extension). So the first thing I need to do is to add the `@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)` annotation on the `FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThemTest` class. Then I can declare my mock with the annotation `@MockK`. Then I changed also the setup method annotation with the new `@BeforeEach` annotation: in this way my class under test will be initialized before each test.  
At this point I have everything setup in order to write the unit test with mock. There are two main MockK construct:

* the `every` behavioural construct, a function where you define what a mock should return for a specific method invocation. There are various operator available to customize the argument matching and the return types.
* the `verify` verification construct and all its declination, where you verify/check which invocation should happen on your mocks.

In my case I rewrote the two unit test of the class using the constructs above. In the first one I used the basic `verify` construct to verify the behaviour of my mocks. In the second one I used the `verifySequence` construct declination, a contruct that checks the order and that all the matched calls are the only calls happened to declared mocks in the verify scope.  
Last but not least, I used again the `@Nested` and `@DisplayName` annotation to declare better names for my tests. I also moved some test static data to the companion object of the test suite class. Below you can find the final code.

```kotlin
package it.chicio.minesweeper.field.resolver

    @BeforeEach
    internal fun setUp() {
        fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem = FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem(fieldResolver)
    }

    @Nested
    @DisplayName("resolve")
    inner class Resolve {
        @Test
        fun `single field list`() {
            every { fieldResolver.resolve(field) } just Runs

            val fields = fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem.resolve(listOf(field))

            assertEquals(fields, listOf(resolvedField))
            verify { fieldResolver.resolve(field) }
        }

        @Test
        fun `fields list`() {
            every { fieldResolver.resolve(field) } returns resolvedField
            every { fieldResolver.resolve(anotherField) } returns anotherResolvedField

            val fields = fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem.resolve(listOf(field, anotherField))

            assertEquals(fields, listOf(resolvedField, anotherResolvedField))
            verifySequence {
                fieldResolver.resolve(field)
                fieldResolver.resolve(anotherField)
            }

                        arrayOf(".", ".", ".", ".", "."),
                        arrayOf(".", "*", ".", ".", ".")

                        arrayOf("3", "3", "2", "0", "0"),
                        arrayOf("1", "*", "1", "0", "0")
