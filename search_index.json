the static type checker for Javascript: how to use it and a brief comparison with TypeScript","content":"\n*Sick and tired of TypeScript? Give a chance to Flow, the JavaScript static type checker from Facebook.*\n\n---\n\nIn my daily job at [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") I usually work with\nTypeScript. Instead, my personal website (the one where you are reading this article), has been developed using\nJavaScript for the client side.  \nAs you may already know JavaScript is untyped, so it doesn't have static typing. This could lead to bugs and it become\nmore error prone proportionally to the increase of the source code base. As I already\nexplained [in another post](/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/),\nTypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript for any browser, any host and any OS.\nTypeScript is basically “JavaScript on steroid”: it provides optional, static type checking at compile time. Since it is\na superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.  \nAs a consequence of the fact that I already use Typescript during my daily job I started to think if there was another\nway to have static type checking on my JavaScript code already in place for my website (the one where you're reading\nthis blog post :smirk:). You know, if you already know a tool or a programming language you want to try the other\ntechnologies you could find on the market so you're prepared for the future in your career :relaxed:. This is the reason\nwhy I decided to use [Flow](https://flow.org/) for my website JavaScript source code.  \nWhat is [Flow](https://flow.org/)? Flow is a static type checker for javascript developed by Facebook. Let's see it's\nmain features taken from the homepage of the official site:\n\n>* TYPE INFERENCE: using data flow analysis, Flow infers types and tracks data as it moves through your code. You don't need to fully annotate your code before Flow can start to find bugs.\n>* REALTIME FEEDBACK: Flow gives you fast feedback while you code by incrementally rechecking your code as you make changes.\n>* JAVASCRIPT, YOUR WAY: Flow is designed to understand idiomatic JavaScript. It understands common JavaScript patterns and many of the weird things we JavaScript developers love to do.\n>* EASY INTEGRATION: Flow integrates well with many tools, making it easy to insert into your existing workflow and toolchain.\n\nIt seems really cool!!! :sunglasses:. In this post I will described my experience with Flow. I will show you how I\nintegrated it in my website JavaScript build process and how I used it to do static type checking for my JavaScript\nsource code. So let's start from the installation process.\n\n#### Installation and setup\n\nFirst of all, I added Flow to my dev dependencies. I decided to use Flow in combination\nwith [flow-remove-types](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-remove-types \"flow remove types\"), a small CLI tool for\nstripping Flow type annotations from files.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev flow-remove-types\nnpm install --save-dev flow-bin\n```\n\nThen I decided to create a new script phase `flow` that launches the script `flow.sh`. In this shell script I do all the\nFlow operations:\n\n* I move into my js folder with `cd _js`\n* I run Flow to execute the static type checking on my code base with the command `../node_modules/.bin/flow`\n* I run flow-remove-types to strip Flow type annotations from JavaScript files. The generated files are saved in the\n  folder `../_jsbuild/` specified in the destination folder flag `-d`. I also specified the `--pretty` option in order\n  to be able to remove the whitespaces that flow-remove-types leaves in the source when it removes the types annotation.\n\nBelow you can see the entire script I created (that you can\nfind [flow script also at this url](https://github.com/chicio/old.chicio.github.io/blob/v1.23.0/_scripts/flow.sh \"flow \nscript\"))\n.\n\n```shell\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\n\n# Enter into js source folder\ncd _js\n\n# Run flow\n../node_modules/.bin/flow\n\n# Remove flow types\n../node_modules/.bin/flow-remove-types ../_js/ -d ../_jsbuild/ -i flow-typed/ --pretty\n```\n\nAs you may expect with a standard npm script phase, I can invoke it in a shell with the command `npm run flow`. The\nfinal step of the setup was to install [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed \"flow typed\"). Flow-type is\na repository of third-party library Flow interface definitions. In the next section I will explain to you why I need\nit (and also you will need it :wink:). Flow-typed must be installed globally. This could be done with the following\ncommand (I ran this command in the setup script I have for my website, that I launch when I have to prepare the\ndevelopment environment on a new computer):\n\n```shell\nnpm install --global flow-typed\n```\n\n#### Adding types\n\nLet's start to add some types. To show you how to add types with Flow I will start with the piece of code you can find\nbelow. This piece of code contains the animation used to show an image after it had been downloaded from the network.\n\n```javascript\nimport { TweenLite } from 'gsap'\n\nconst lazyLoadImageAnimation = (image, delay) => {\n  TweenLite.from(image, 0.3, {\n    opacity: 0,\n    delay\n  })\n}\n\nexport { lazyLoadImageAnimation }\n```\n\nThe first thing I have to do is to tell to Flow that I want to check the types for this file. To do this I just have to\nadd the comment `/* @flow */` at the top of the file.  \nThen I can start to add types. Flow supports the following primitive types\n\n* boolean\n* number\n* string\n* void (undefined)\n* null\n* any, a way to opt-out of using the type checker. A variable of type `any` will accept any type of value. Using any is\n  completely unsafe, and should be avoided whenever possible.\n* mixed, will accept any type of value as `any`. The difference is that when you try to use a value of a mixed type you\n  must first figure out what the actual type is or you’ll end up with an error.\n\nObviously Flow support also objects, classes and interface. So I can try to add the types to the parameters of\nthe `lazyLoadImageAnimation` function. The first parameter is an DOM element that is then passed to the TweenLite `from`\nfunction. So I can try to give the [Element class type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) to\nthe `image` parameter. The second parameter, `delay`, is a number used to tweak the TweenLite animation configuration.\nSo, as you may expect :bowtie:, I can try to give the type `number` to it. Below you can find the final implementation\nwith Flow types.\n\n```javascript\n/* @flow */\nimport { TweenLite } from 'gsap'\n\nconst lazyLoadImageAnimation = (image: Element, delay: number): void => {\n  TweenLite.from(image, 0.3, {\n    opacity: 0,\n    delay\n  })\n}\n\nexport { lazyLoadImageAnimation }\n```\n\nIf I try to run `npm run flow` I expect that everything goes well, but instead...I received the following error: \"**\nCannot resolve module gsap.**\". Below in the screenshot you can see the error reported.\n\n![An example of the error emitted by flow when the types check is executed](../images/posts/flow-error-module.jpg)\n\nWhat's happening here? The `TweenLite` class is imported from the third party\nlibrary [`gsap`](https://greensock.com/gsap) and Flow doesn't know the types definition for it. I have to provide this\ndefinition in order to enable Flow to do the type checking also on the parts of code that refer to a third library. This\ncan be done in two ways:\n\n* check to see if the [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed \"flow typed\") repo contains the types\n  definition for the library I'm using and eventually install it\n* write your own Flow type definition for the library you are using if it is not present in the flow-typed directory\n\nUnfortunately, in this case the flow-typed repository doesn't contain a type definition for the `gsap` library. So I\nwill need to write my own gsap library types definition. How can I do that? First of all let's create a folder inside\nthe project called `flow-typed` (what a coincidence!!!! :smirk:). This is the standard folder where Flow searches for\nthird party library types definition. If you want you can customize the search path with a custom folder in\nthe `.flowconfig` file. Then I create a new file `gsap.js` inside it. In this file I declare a new module definition\nwith the syntax `declare module \"<module name>\"`. In this case it will be `declare module \"gsap\"`. Then I can declare a\nnew class to be exported, `TweenLite`, that is the one I'm using in the piece of code above. To this class I will add\nthe definition for all the method I'm using and for which I need the Flow type definition. From the piece of code above\nit's easy to see that the only method I'm using is `from(...)`, so I can add the types definition only for it. To do\nthis I just have to declare the signature of the method with the types I expect for each parameter. One thing to be\nnoted is that the first and the third parameter could accept different types as specified in the gsap documentation.\nThis is why I put `any` as type. Basically I'm saying that for the first and third parameter I don't want to do any type\ncheck :laughing:. Below you can find the complete declaration implementation.\n\n```javascript\ndeclare module \"gsap\" {\n  declare\n\n  export class TweenLite extends Animation {\n    static from(target: any, duration: number, vars: any): TweenLite;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf I try to run again the command `npm run flow` everything will work as expected :relieved:.  \nLet's see another example. The piece of code below is used to load a webfont with the help of the `webfontloader`\nlibrary.\n\n```javascript\nimport WebFont from 'webfontloader'\n\nconst loadFont = (finish) => {\n  WebFont.load({\n    google: { families: ['Open Sans'] },\n    active: finish ? finish() : undefined,\n    inactive: finish ? finish() : undefined\n  })\n}\n\nexport { loadFont }\n```\n\nLet's start by adding the type for the `finish` parameter. The `finish` parameter is a function that could be null, so I\nneed to use a [maybe type](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/maybe/ \"flow maybe type\"), usually known as Optional types. So\nI need to declare it as an optional function `?(() => void)`. Then again I have an import from an external\nlibrary `webfontloader`. In this case the webfontloader module declaration could be taken from\nthe [flow-typed](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed \"flow typed\") repo. To do that, I can install the definition\ncontained in that repo in my source code with the following command:\n\n```shell\nflow-typed install webfontloader@v1.x.x\n```\n\nNow I'm ready to run the command `npm run flow` again. Everything works as expected and Flow says that my types are\ncorrect. This is the final version of the source could with all the types.\n\n```javascript\nimport WebFont from 'webfontloader'\n\nconst loadFont = (finish: ?(() => void)): void => {\n  WebFont.load({\n    google: { families: ['Open Sans'] },\n    active: finish ? finish() : undefined,\n    inactive: finish ? finish() : undefined\n  })\n}\n\nexport { loadFont }\n```\n\n#### Flow vs TypeScript\n\nSo how does Flow compare to TypeScript? The main reasons to choose Flow instead of TypeScript are:\n\n* **It's an easy-to-use utility**. Flow is is not a complete language like TypeScript. It is an utility that you can add\n  to your code. this could be as simple as just\n  put [`/* @flow */` at the beginning of the file](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/comparing-flow-with-typescript-6a8ff7fd4cbb)\n  . In fact with Flow you're still, writing JavaScript code.\n* **very good React support**. Flow comes from Facebook as React, so you will find easier to integrate Flow with React\n  and React Native.\n\nThe cons of Flow with respect to TypeScript are:\n\n* **smaller community compared to the TypeScript one.** This basically means that for Flow you will find fewer\n  tutorials, online resources and library definitions.\n* **better IDE integrations**. TypeScript is much better supported in terms of automated refactoring tools\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis is my experience with Flow. In the end I think it's a good alternative to TypeScript, especially for the \"true pure\njavascript lovers\". Let me know in the comments if you like it :cupid: or if you prefer TypeScript :smiling_imp:.\n","slug":"/2019/04/07/flow-javascript-types-typescript/","description":"Sick and tired of TypeScript? Give a chance to Flow, the JavaScript static type checker from Facebook.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"0620f1cb-75dc-5eb0-9ee0-236c9f6b7ace":{"title":"Blender tutorial: animation","content":"\n*In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about animations.*\n\n---\n\nIn the [previous post of the series \"Blender tutorial\"](/2019/03/26/blender-tutorial-12-camera-rendering/) we talked\nabout camera and rendering options/effects in Blender. In this post we will talk about animation. Let's start from the\ntimeline. The timeline is usually placed at the bottom of the default layout of Blender. In it you can select a specific\nframe by clicking on it in the timeline. We also have some controls to start/stop/fast back and forward the animation.\nThere is also the possibility to set a start and end frame of the animation.\n\n![The animation timeline](../images/posts/blender-animation-timeline.jpg\")\n\nTo create an animation we need first of all to set keyframes. To do this we have to select the frame that we want as\nkeyframe in the timeline, and the go in the space properties panel, change one of the spatial properties we want to\nanimate (location, rotation or scale) and right click on them to show a menu where we can select \"Insert keyframes\".\nAfter that you will see the value of the property we decided to animate to become yellow (orange in my images below\nbecause I have a custom theme).\n\n![Set animation keyframe](../images/posts/blender-animation-set-keyframe-1.jpg)\n\n![Keyframe properties](../images/posts/blender-animation-set-keyframe-2.jpg)\n\nTo make an animation we need at least 2 keyframes. We can set keyframes also by selecting the record button in the\ntimeline. This button will let us set a keyframe for the property we select from the list just near it. The keyframes\nare shown on the timeline as a yellow line.\n\n![Another way to set keyframes](../images/posts/blender-animation-set-keyframe-3.jpg)\n\nAfter settings the second keyframe we finally have our first animation. In the video below you can see the final result.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTLJL-HF9vY`\n\nIn our previous first animation we animated the movement of the object. In Blender we are not limited to location or\nrotation for animation: we can basically animate any property we want. We can animate color, scale, light camera and so\non. Let's see for example how we can animate the energy property of a light. To do this we basically have to follow the\nsame approach we used for the previous location animation: we modify the energy property and we set a keyframe for each\nvalue we want (remember that we need at least two keyframe to have an animation). After that our animation is ready and\ncan be played (remember to switch the 3D window to texture mode if you want to see the animation with execute a complete\nrender).\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ledh539mZKo`\n\nSometimes we will need to do to a more precise setup of our animation: change the values between keyframes, change the\ninterpolation method and so on. To do these operation we can use the graph editor. This is a a separate editor that we\ncan open by selecting graph editor from editor selector in an existing panel inside our Blender layout (or in a new\npanel created ad-hoc). In this new editor we can zoom in/out by using ctrl + mouse movement. On the left you will find\nall the animation for a specific object selected in the scene. From here we can modify the keyframe curve by selecting\nit and moving in the position we prefer. We can also modify the interpolation by selecting our animation curve and\nchoosing Key -> Interpolation mode from the menu.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq1J5QrJuSU`\n\n![Interpolation mode](../images/posts/blender-animation-interpolation-mode.jpg)\n\nThe graph editor in not the only animation editor. We can use also the dope sheet. It could be more faster to edit an\nanimation in it instead of the animation editor. In it we don't have the curve of interpolation of the animation. We\njust have a representation of the keyframes and we can edit them by dragging after selection with a right click of the\nmouse. Last but not least we have animation path. To create an animation path we have to add a path by using the menu\nAdd -> Curve -> Path. Then we need to add a constraint to the object we want to animate so that it will follow the path.\nAfter that we can set the keyframes using the same approach showed before.\n\n![Add curve path](../images/posts/blender-path-add-curve.jpg)\n\n![Set path constraint](../images/posts/blender-path-set-constraint.jpg)\n\nThat's all for animation. In the next post we will talk about character rigging.\n","slug":"/2019/03/27/blender-tutorial-13-animation/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about animations.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"06becc51-d6f6-564f-b0cf-2dcc5141b4d8":{"title":"How to test your Swift source code on Linux: locally and on Github Actions","content":"\n*Quick tips (useful for open source projects) for testing your Swift source code on Linux locally\nand with Github Actions.*\n\n---\n\nIn my [previous posts](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2018/05/08/id3tageditor-swift-read-write-id3-tag-mp3/ \n\"id3tageditor swift\") I already talked a lot (maybe too much :sweat_smile: ) about my open source project \n[ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor \"id3 tag swift\"), that recently surpassed one hundred stars on \ngithub! :tada: In particular, if you read my article about [creating a Swift library for Linux and macOS](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2019/01/03/swift-package-manager-linux-macos-create-library-executable/ \"swift \nlibrary linux macos\") you already know that ID3TagEditor officially support also the Linux platform. In last years I \nhave been an \"Apple fan\" guy, and I have only Apple devices in my home. So how do I test a new feature or a change \nto the ID3TagEditor library on Linux? In this article I will show you two quick tips on how you can test a Linux \ncompatible Swift library on Linux locally on your machine (without the need for a dual boot installation) and in your \nGithub CI workflow with Github Actions. \n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start from the local testing. If you go to the official Swift website, there's a section dedicated to the \nofficially supported platform. From there you can go to the [download section](https://swift.org/download/#docker) where you can find all links to the \nlatest swift source packages for each supported platform. If you go at the end of this section there a docker \nsection specifically related to Ubuntu Linux! So guess what? We can use Docker to test our Swift source code on \nLinux.So start docker and then run the command below from the root dir of our source code.  \n\n```shell\ndocker run --rm --privileged \\\n        --interactive --tty \\\n        --name swift-latest \\\n        --volume \"$(pwd):/ID3TagEditor\" \\\n        --workdir \"/ID3TagEditor\" \\\n        swift:latest /bin/bash \n```\n\nYou can replace the `ID3TagEditor` folder name above with any name you want. After the container is created you will \nbe in your source code dir and you can use the usual `swift build`, `swift test` (and if you need `swift package \nclean`) to test your source code.  \nNow that you tested your code locally you are ready to publish it on Github. Obviously you want to put in place a \nCI workflow with Github Actions to test that changes to the code will not break it. How can you do it? If you search \non Google, you will find some Github Actions that replicate with some scripts all the steps needed in order to \ninstall Swift on Linux. Do NOT use them!! There's no need for this type of actions!! :satisfied: In fact we just \nneed to read carefully the [Github Actions syntax documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer \"github action syntax documentation\").    \nIf you scroll down that page you will find that you can launch a container on your Github Action runner on top of \nthe [virtual environment](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) of your GitHub Actions hosted runners. So \nwe just need to specify the container image name, and we are done!! :tada: You can also check the previous \ndocumentation link for other customization option if you need them. Below you can find the [Github Action yaml I'm \nusing for ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-linux.yml) (you can copy/paste it in your projects and remove last part to use it).\n\n```yaml\nname: Build Linux\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - '*'\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Build Linux\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container:\n      image: swift:latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Build Linux framework\n        run: |\n          swift build\n          swift test\n      - name: Build Linux Demo\n        run: |\n          cd Demo/Demo\\ Ubuntu\n          swift build\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYes that's all for Swift testing on Linux locally and on Github Actions. I promised you it would have been a \"quick \ntips\" post. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: I hope you will find it useful.  \n","slug":"/2021/05/31/swift-linux-test-local-ci-docker-container/","description":"Quick tips (useful for open source projects) for testing your Swift source code on Linux locally  and with Github Actions.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"083c1500-2a5e-54dc-98d5-86fdbbfda4eb":{"title":"My first experience as speaker at Voxxed Days 2018: a talk about React, React Native and Typescript","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about my first experience as a speaker at a conference: a talk about React, React Native and\nTypescript with Alessandro Romano.*\n\n---\n\nIn the last few months I talked a lot\nabout [React Native and Typescript](/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/). In the team where I work at\nlastminute.com group I acquired a strong knowledge of the Typescript + React + React Native technology stack. There has\nbeen also some few changes in the team: [Emanuele Ianni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueleianni/ \"Emanuele Ianni\"), (\ndo you remember I already talked about him [in my previous post?](/2018/03/20/golden-master-test-characterization-test-legacy-code/)),\nmy technical team leader left the company. He was supposed to do a talk at Voxxed 2018 about our journey as a team into the world of React\n+ React Native + Typescript. So I got the opportunity to go in his place to the Voxxed as a co-speaker\nof [Alessandro Romano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandroromano92/ \"Alessandro Romano\"), my other colleague selected\nas a speaker for this event. Alessandro, also known as \"the Clean\", is a senior software developer with many years of\nexperience that just got graduated from University of Insubria in Varese (do you remember\nI [already talked also about him?](/2018/08/02/design-thinking-design-sprint-workshop/)). The title of the talk\nwas: **React (Native) & Typescript: A journey to a unified team using a common language**. In this post I will talk\nabout all the process we went into from the first draft preparation until the talk :grin:.\n\n### Slides preparation\n\nLet's start from the slides preparation. I started to work on the presentation with Alessandro two months before the\nevent. We decided to structure our talk as a story telling. We begin describing how our team was composed and how we\napplied agile methodologies: basically, we were divided in three silos, back-end, front-end and mobile doing separated\nuser stories and ceremonies. Then we embraced a new journey, we challenged ourself to become a feature team having\nend-to-end user stories and unified ceremonies. The technology stack we chose was the main facilitator of this process\nand eventually transformed us into the mythological creature of the full-stack developer and it was composed of:\n\n* TypeScript as common language\n* React for the frontend of the customer area (manage all the products of your booking) of our websites\n* React Native for the frontend of the mobile apps of our main brands\n\nAfter this introduction we created a section for each of the technology above were we described the pros and cons of\neach one. Last but not least we presented the Cross Selling feature: a real use case in which we were able to share the\nbusiness logic between the two environments using a pure TypeScript library.\n\n### Company dry run, feedback and final present\n\nWhen the presentation was ready we planned an internal dry run. We usually call this kind of meetings \"schiscia time\"\nbecause they are planned during lunch time: the participants will enjoy their launch while the speakers show their\nstuff. So we planned our \"schiscia time\" for the 8th October. A lot of colleagues attended the talk and gave some very\nuseful feedback. The two major observation we received were:\n\n* **less coding**. We created a lot of slides with screenshots taken directly from our IDEs with a lot of code,\n  especially in the section of the presentation where we described the new technology stack we \"married\". They were not\n  so easy to read and in some cases they were actually stealing the focus of our attendees. So we decided to remove\n  them. The only slides with code that we kept were the ones in the section \"Share the code: cross selling feature\"\n  where we present a real use case of development on our products. On this slides we changed the IDEs screenshots with\n  some formatted code using a syntax highlighter (and honestly, after that change the slides looked much more\n  beautiful :heart_eyes:).\n\n* **more focus on the journey**. A lot of our colleagues told us that from the presentation they didn't feel what it\n  took to transform ourselves from platform specific developer to the mythological creature of the full-stack developer.\n  In our presentation there were a lot details about React, React Native and TypeScript but not as much on our workflow\n  with the new technology stack. In fact after choosing React + React Native + TypeScript we started to:\n    * do pair programming without considering the technology skills\n    * do end-to-end user stories, from the backend service to the frontend (mobile app and web)\n\nSo we started to review the slides and we basically created a new presentation :smile:. It took us almost a week. After\nthe review we made 2 simulations of the entire presentation during the week before the event to be more confident. Last\nbut not least, the Human Resources department gave us a company t-shirt to promote our company brand at the conference.\n\n![The t-shirt used during the presentation at Voxxed 2018](../images/posts/voxxed-2018-tshirt.jpg)\n\n### The talk\n\nThen the day of the talk arrived after a not so quiet sleep. The Voxxed Days 2018 in Ticino was set to take place on\n20th of October. We arrived at the \"Palazzo dei Congressi\" in Lugano at 8.45 AM. We were excited to queue in the\ndedicated speakers area for the first time after so many conferences attended! We checked-in and got our shiny speaker\nbadge. Then we moved to the lounge section to enjoy breakfast.\n\n![The Voxxed 2018 breakfast](../images/posts/voxxed-2018-breakfast.jpg)\n\nOur talk was planned at 2.30 PM, so we had time to attend some other sessions. At 11.50 AM we decided to do a last\npresentation simulation to review some details and then we went to lunch. At 2.00 PM we started to feel the strain. The\nstart of our talk was really close. We entered in the room of our session at 2.15 PM and we did the setup of our laptop\nfor the presentation.\n\n![Computer setup during Voxxed 2018 pre-talk preparation](../images/posts/voxxed-2018-pre-talk.jpg)\n\nThen the room started to fill in. As scheduled at 2.30 PM we started our presentation. The presentation went smooth. We\nkept the scheduled time per slide we planned in our simulation. The change of speaker between the various part of the\npresentation worked perfectly. At the end we answered to some questions and we received applause from the audience.\n\n![The Voxxed 2018 talk](../images/posts/voxxed-2018-talk.jpg)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThat's all for my first experience as a conference speaker. It has been a good experience. After 10 years in the IT\nfield (had I already been working for 10 years?!??! :cold_sweat:) it was a great pleasure to be on the other side of the\nstage.\n\n![Me and Alessandro 'the clean' Romano](../images/posts/voxxed-2018-clean.jpg)\n\nSpecial thanks to all the team Lynch that give me the opportunity to be the \"replacement\" speaker for this conference.\nSpecial thanks also to  [Alessandro Romano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandroromano92/ \"Alessandro Romano\") \"the\nclean\".

From innovative debugging tools to cross-platform development strategies, we’ll walk you through \nwhat we found valuable and how it’s shaping our approach to React and React Native development.*\n\n---\n\nRecently, my colleague [Sam Campisi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-campisi-9a70b5a1/) and I had the privilege of\nattending the 2024 edition of the React Universe Conference.\nThis event, organized by [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/), was previously known as React Native EU.\nHowever, this year Callstack decided to take a different approach: the conference now aims to become the leading point of\nreference for the React community in Europe,\ncovering both web and mobile development in what they defined the \"React Universe\":\na tech stack with a set of tools to build applications across platforms.\nLet’s dive into the key insights we gathered during the conference and explore what the future holds for React and React Native.\n\n#### Some numbers\n\nBefore diving into the details of the speakers and topics presented, let’s take a look at some key data about the conference:\n\n**Location:** Wrocław Congress Center  \n**Dates:** 4-6 September 2024  \n**Attendees:** 650  \n**Speakers:** 30  \n**Talks:** 22\n\nThe venue was absolutely stunning.\nThe Wrocław Congress Center provided the perfect setting for the event,\nwith a large auditorium spacious enough to comfortably accommodate all attendees.\nCallstack spared no expense in making sure everything was top-notch:\nfrom the stage design to the food, every detail was carefully curated.\n\nAs for the speakers, they were exceptional, with many being key contributors to the React ecosystem.\nNow, let’s dive into some of the mind-blowing innovations that were unveiled during the conference.\n\n#### Day 1: Key Talks\n\nThe first day was full of talks focused on the improvements they will soon land in React Native.\nThere were also some talks\nabout how to scale your React Native app and tools to bring you applications on multiple platforms.\n\n##### Opening Speech\n\nThe conference was kicked off by **Michał Pierzchała**,\nwho provided a thorough overview of the React community's current status.\nHe emphasized how React and React Native are increasingly converging,\naiming to offer a seamless development experience across web and mobile platforms.\nThis unified direction highlights the importance\nof creating consistent user experiences regardless of the underlying technology.\n\n![react universe opening speed](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-native-web.jpeg \"Strong messages from the react community\")\n\n##### 🎉 What a Year for React Native!\n\nIn this session,\n**Nicola Corti** and **Riccardo Cipolleschi** from Meta reflected on the significant progress\nmade in the React Native ecosystem over the past year.\nThey discussed the growing importance of using frameworks like **Expo**.\nThis is something already shared by the React Native core team in a post on their official [blog](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/06/25/use-a-framework-to-build-react-native-apps).\nTo remark the shift to the \"use a framework\" approach, they also announced the deprecation of the **react-native cli**.\nThe cli will be published in an ad hoc React Native community package,\nand when you launch an init command, a deprecation message will be shown.\n\n![react universe nicola corti](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-react-native.jpeg \"Use a framework \ndirection, shown by Nicola Corti from Meta\")\n\nAnother news shared is related to the next release 0.76 and the fact\nthat the new architecture will be enabled by default.\nThis will enhance app performance and development capabilities.\nThe session concluded with a look at emerging tools,\nsuch as [react-strict-dom](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom),\nwhich is the Meta answer for having a library of shareable components between web and mobile.\n\n##### 🛠 The New React Native Debugger\n\n**Alex Hunt** from Meta introduced the new **React Native Debugger**, which replaces the older **Flipper** tool.\nThe new debugger, called **React Native Dev Tools**,\nis automatically enabled in version 0.76, and offers a debugging experience that mirrors **React DevTools** through a CDP session.\nAlex highlighted how this update makes debugging smoother and more intuitive\n(with respect to what was happening in the past).\nHe promised that the new debugger will \"just work\" — though\nhe jokingly admitted the community would have to see for themselves.\nThis tool represents a significant improvement in terms \"ease of use\" and functionality for developers\nworking with React Native.\n\n![react universe alex hunt debugger](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-react-native-devtools.jpeg \"The new React Native DevTools, available from React Native 0.76\")\n\n##### 👓 React Native ❤ Apple Vision Pro\n\nIn an exciting presentation,\n**Oskar Kwaśniewski** from Callstack revealed the future of **React Native** on **Apple’s Vision Pro**.\nThis groundbreaking work focuses on \"progressive enhancement,\"\nallowing developers to gradually improve app experiences without sacrificing compatibility with different platforms.\nOskar explained how Callstack is maintaining a fork of React Native specifically developed for Vision Pro,\nwith live demos already showcased at the conference.\n\n![react universe apple vision pro](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-apple-vision-pro.jpeg \"React native for visionos, maintained by callstack.io\")\n\nWhile the project is still in its early stages, the potential\nto develop immersive apps for Vision Pro using React Native has sparked a lot of enthusiasm within the community.\nDevelopers can follow the progress of this initiative on GitHub:\n[react-native-visionos](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-visionos).\n\n##### 📈 Hard-learned Lessons in App Scaling\n\n**Mike Duminy** from Klarna shared invaluable insights on the challenges of scaling large applications, based on Klarna’s experience.\nHis talk emphasized the importance of continuously measuring what truly matters by reviewing KPIs\n(Key Performance Indicators), and also define them to let you work on both product and technical features.\nHe stressed the need for **incremental migration**,\nrecommending that developers enforce new rules for updated parts of their apps,\nwhile also embracing the complex challenges that arise from scaling.\nThis talk served as a reminder\nthat success in scaling requires a combination of strategic planning and community collaboration,\nby contributing back to the open source community (eg. contributing to React Native, Hermes etc.)\n\n![react universe aklarna](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-klarna.jpeg \"Hard-learned Lessons in App Scaling\")\n\n##### 🪄 How you can Server-Render without Rendering on the Server \n\nMike Grabowski and Eric Vicenti presented an intriguing talk focused on a cutting-edge approach called React Server-Defined Components (RSDC),\nwhich enables developers to offload much of the rendering logic to the client while still maintaining control from the server.\nThis method allows developers to modify user interfaces on the fly without requiring traditional server-side rendering or pushing updates via over-the-air\n(OTA) methods.\nThey introduced a new set of tools, called **RISE Tools**,\nwhich allows for real-time UI updates and dynamic content changes directly from the server,\nwithout needing new client-side deployments.\n\n![react universe rise tools](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-rise.jpeg \"RISE tools by Mike Grabowski and Eric Vicenti\")\n\nThis method significantly simplifies managing large-scale apps,\noffering instant flexibility for rearranging elements or adding new features,\neven after an app has gone live.\n\n#### Day 2: Key Talks\n\nThe second day of the conference was centered again around tools for bringing your application to multiple platforms.\nThere were also some talks related to React Native internals.\n\n##### ❓ React 'use client' Explained\n\n**Delba de Oliveira** from Vercel provided a deep dive into React’s **'use client'** directive, which allows developers\nto convert server-rendered components into client-rendered ones.\nThis powerful tool eliminates the need for complex network synchronization,\noffering a smoother and more responsive user experience.\nDelba illustrated how **use client** pre-renders interactive UIs on the server,\nbut then switches to client-side rendering for dynamic interactions.\nThis approach creates a clear boundary between static content and interactive elements,\nsimplifying the development of fast, dynamic web applications.\n\n##### 🕸 Web Once, Native Everywhere\n\nIn one of the more forward-thinking talks, **Evan Bacon** from Expo unveiled **Expo DOM Components**,\nan experimental package\nthat allows developers to write web components that are compatible across native and web platforms.\nThis innovation offers fast compile-time injection of **WebView** and **React DOM components**,\nmaking it particularly useful for projects that require incremental migration from web to mobile environments.\n\n##### 🩵 Web Without Walls\n\nDan Abramov’s talk “Web Without Walls”\nat React Universe Conf 2024 focused on the potential of creating more open, decentralized web platforms,\ndrawing from his work with BlueSky.\nDan explored how modern web applications often lock users into restrictive ecosystems,\nleading to limited control over personal data and interactions.\nIn contrast, he emphasized the importance of giving users more autonomy through decentralized protocols and customizable user experiences,\naiming to break down the “walls” of the internet.\nHis insights pointed to a future where social platforms and web applications become more interoperable, user-centric,\nand open to innovation.\n\n![react universe web without walls](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-dan-abramov.jpeg \"Web without walls by Dan Abramov\")\n\n##### 🏃🏻‍♂️ Hermes: better performance with runtime bytecode translation (Tzvetan Mikov, Meta)\n\nThis presentation focused on how Hermes, Meta’s JavaScript engine designed for React Native, leverages runtime bytecode translation\nto significantly enhance performance and the current status of **static Hermes**.\nThe key innovation discussed was how Hermes optimizes JavaScript execution by converting code into an efficient intermediate bytecode at runtime,\nwhich allows for faster execution and lower memory consumption, particularly on resource-constrained devices.\n\n![react universe hermes](../images/posts/react-universe-2024-hermes.jpeg \"Hermes: better performance with runtime bytecode translation\")\n\nMikov delved into the technical specifics of how Hermes helps to reduce startup times\nand improve the overall performance of React Native apps by processing JavaScript ahead of time,\nwhile also allowing for real-time translation during execution.\nHe did show additionally some improvements\nrecently added to Hermes\nto speed up the bytecode execution by generating slow and fast execution paths based on the typing.  \nThese techniques help achieve a balance between speed and flexibility, catering to both static and dynamic use cases.\nBy incorporating these optimizations, Hermes continues to be a game-changer for mobile app performance,\nespecially in environments with limited hardware capabilities.\n\n#### Conclusion and Key Takeaways\n\nAs the conference wrapped up, the key messages resonated throughout the community:\n\n* **“Native is similar to web.”** The lines between native and web development continue to blur, with frameworks like Expo bridging the gap.\n* **“Web is just another platform.”** reflects the community growing vision of treating the web as one of many platforms rather than the default.\n* **Cross-platform solutions are the future.** With the rise of tools like **Expo Universal Apps** and **Rise Tools** and improvements in **React Native Windows** and **visionOS**, the community is actively working on tools that will make cross-platform development more seamless than ever.\n\nReact Universe 2024 was an exciting glimpse into the future of React and React Native.\nThe talks showcased how the community is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in cross-platform development.\nIt’s clear that the next few years will bring even more innovations and tools to make development faster,\nmore efficient, and more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n#### References\n\n- [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)\n- [Hermes

In this post we will start to add some details\nto our models by learning how to use **materials**.  \nTo set a material on an object we can select the material tab from the properties panel, and the press the new button.\n\n![blender create material](../images/posts/blender-create-material.jpg)\n\nAfter creating we material a new list of option to customize it appears. We have the possibility to change the\nmaterial's name. We can select the material type. The available options are:\n\n* *Surface*, render object as a surface\n* *Wire*, render the edges of faces as wires\n* *Volume*, render object as a volume\n* *Halo*, render object as halo particles\n\nMost of the time (9/10 times) we will use the surface types. The other are for special effects we will see in the\nfuture. Then we have other options to customize the main components of the material. The definitions given below of\nthese components are from an artist point of view. If you're interested to know the details on the computer graphics\nside, you can have a look\nat [this documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_lighting \"Lighting computer graphics\")\n(on the web you can find plenty of resources about this topic). So the main material components are:\n\n* *diffuse*, the main color of the objects\n* *specular*, that define the highlights\n* *shading*, that defines the type light emission of the material, the ambient component that empirically models the\n  result of indirect lighting and other options (that we will see in details later)\n* *transparency*\n* *mirror*\n* *subsurface scattering*, to model material in which light will enter on a point of the surface and will exit from\n  another one. This component is useful to model translucency effects.\n* *strand*, to model hair particles\n* *shadows*\n* *other options*\n\n![The material panel](../images/posts/blender-material-panel.jpg)\n\nWe can assign multiple material to the same objects. To do it we just need to :\n\n* add a new material slot using the plus button\n* select (in edit mode) the part of the object to which we want to apply the material and click the assign button\n\n![It is possible to assign multiple material to the same objects](../images/posts/blender-multiple-material.jpg)\n\nNow let's star to have a deeper look at the **diffuse component**. As we said before, the diffuse component defines the\nmain color of our object. The default shader applied to it is the lambert shader. Lambertian is an ideal diffuse\nreflection that ideally reflect equally the light in all direction. We have also the possibility to choose one of the\nother shaders:\n\n* *Oren-Nayar*, a shader that models also the roughness of the surface\n* *Toon shading*, a shader with hard light cutting off\n* *Minnaert*, a shader with rim-light effects (useful when you need this effects but you don't wont to place a light\n  behind the object)\n* *Fresnel*, a shader that also inverts specularity of the objects.\n\nAll the diffuse shader types have an intensity parameter to adjust their contribution to the final look of the objects.\n\n![The material diffuse component](../images/posts/blender-material-diffuse-component.jpg)\n\nAfter the diffuse component there's the **specular component**. This component is used to represent the\nhighlights/shininess of the surface. We can select the color as for the diffuse shader. We also have again a intensity\nparameter to tweak the contribution of the specular component to the final material appearance. There's a list of shader\nwe can choose from:\n\n* *cook-torrance*\n* *phong*\n* *blinn-phong*\n* *toon*\n* *wardiso*\n\n![The material specular component](../images/posts/blender-material-specular-component.jpg)\n\nFor both the diffuse and specular component we have also the **ramp option**. With this option it is possible to apply\ngradient on the surface. The ramp option could be useful to add a little bit more pop to the material final look. The\nstarting values for ramp contains two color, but we can add as many intermediate points as we want.\n\n![The ramp material](../images/posts/blender-ramp-material.jpg)\n\nWe have also some shading option that we can use to set other to surface components. In particular we can set the\nambient and emit components using the slider contained in this section. We can also completely turn off the shader by\nusing the shadeless option, or using the tangent shading option to create tangent specular highlights.\n\n![Shading options](../images/posts/blender-shading-options.jpg)\n\nNow we will take a look at how we can create **reflective material**. To create a reflective material we can activate\nthe Mirror component. We have some options to customize the final result of our reflection:\n\n* *reflectivity*, that let us customize the amount of reflection\n* *fresnel*, that let us customize the amount of reflection at grazing incidence\n* *depth*, the maximum number of reflection bounce\n* *max dist*, the maximum distance of object to be reflected\n* *gloss*, to setup a glossy reflection effect\n\nRemember that the mirror material result is visible only in the final render view.\n\n![The mirror material useful to implement reflection](../images/posts/blender-reflection.jpg)\n\nAfter mirror material we can take a look at the **transparency component**. To make a transparent material we have to\nactivate this component. There are 3 option:\n\n* *z transparency*, a simple transparency without refraction or any other sort of realistic features\n* *mask*, a simple masks for the Background. It uses the alpha channel to mix the color of each pixel on the active\n  object plane with the color of the corresponding background pixel, according to the alpha channel of the pixel\n* *raytrace*, a realistic transparency configurable with Index Of Refraction (IOR) and other parameters.\n\n![The transparency component](../images/posts/blender-transparency.jpg)\n\nLast but not least we have **subsurface scattering**. As reported\non [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering \"Subsurface scattering\"):\n\n> Subsurface scattering is a mechanism of light transport in which light penetrates the surface of a translucent object, is scattered by interacting with the material, and exits the surface at a different point\n\nWe have some parameter to modify the final result of this component:\n\n* *index of refraction*\n* *scale*, to determine how deep the light goes\n* *RGB radius*, that is a color used to blur\n* *scattering weights*, to tweak if the effects it is more on front then on the back\n* *blend*\n\n![Subsurface scattering](../images/posts/blender-subsurface-scattering.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will talk about textures.\n","slug":"/2019/03/21/blender-tutorial-7-materials/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about materials.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"1ad5749c-e9a2-56a2-aa4a-6fb08dee1b84":{"title":"Blender tutorial: selecting and transforming objects","content":"\n*Second post of the \"Blender tutorial\" series. This time we will learn how to select and move objects.*\n\n---\n\nIn\nthe [first post of the \"Blender tutorial\" series](/2018/01/31/blender-tutorial-1-user-interface/ \"Blender tutorial:user interface\")\nwe learned how the user interface is composed and the most important commands to navigate inside a scene. This time we\nwill be focus on selecting and moving objects inside the 3D view.  \nWe can **select an object** by using the *right button of your mouse*. If you're on the MacBook like me, the right mouse\nis emulated in some ways (my personal preferences is to use two fingers to emulate a right click). To *select multiple\nobjects* we can hold the *shift button and select with a right click the objects* we want. The objects that we will\nselect will be marked in the outliner editor, with a little circle, and in the 3D view with a little border. The color\nof the border will change based on the theme you selected. In the screenshot below we can see that I selected 2 of the 3\nobjects in the scene. If we have multiple objects selected, the last one will have a different border. In my case the\ncube is the last object selected.\n\n![Object selection in Blender](../images/posts/blender-selecting-objects-1.jpg)\n\nTo deselect an object we can just right click on it again. We can also **select all the objects** in a scene, including\ncameras and lights, by pressing the *\"a\" key*.  \nThere's also a select menu that gives us more control over the selections we can do. In particular, we have the **Circle\nselect**, that lets us select objects based on a circle pattern of selection, and the **Border select**, that lets us\nselect objects based on a squared pattern of selection. There are also other option to select random objects or invert\nthe current selection.\n\n![Selection menu in Blender](../images/posts/blender-selecting-objects-2.jpg)\n\nTo **translate objects**, we can use the transform tools. We can find them under *Tools -> Transform*. As a consequence\nof the fact that we are trying to translate an object in 3D space using the mouse pointer that works in 2D space, it is\ndifficult to understand in which direction we are doing our translation. We can **constraint the move** to just one axis\nby pressing:\n\n* *\"x\" key* for the x axis\n* *\"y\" key* for the y axis\n* *\"z\" key* for the z axis\n\n![Translation of objects in Blender](../images/posts/blender-translating-objects-1.jpg)\n\nThere's also the possibility to move an object with discrete values by using its location properties panel under the\nproperties editor or using the object properties panel in the 3D window. Finally we can move objects using also the 3D\nmanipulator widget in the 3D window. We can activate it by pressing on its icon. After that when you select and object\nyou will see three axes. Drag one of them to translate the object in that direction.\n\n![Moving objects in Blender](../images/posts/blender-translating-objects-2.jpg)\n\nWe can rotate and scaling an object using the same tools we used for the translation:\n\n* the transformation tools\n* the 3D manipulator widget\n\nOne important thing to consider when we are working with transformation is the transform orientation. This option\ndefines the orientation of the transform operation. This is very important because it influences the final result of the\ntransform operation. You can change the transform orientation in the 3D manipulator widget.\n\n![3D manipulator widget](../images/posts/blender-translating-objects-3.jpg)\n\nThe 3D manipulator widget will place the start of the **transform based on the origin of an objects**. We can **change\nit** by selecting one of the option under Object -> Transform in object mode:\n\n* *Geometry to origin*\n* *Origin to geometry*\n* *Origin to 3D cursor*\n* *Origin to Center of mass (surface)*\n* *Origin to center of mass (volume)*\n\n![Object transform](../images/posts/blender-change-origin-objects-1.jpg)\n\nWhen we want to transform a group of objects at once we have a number of options to change the pivot point of the\nselection. We can choose it by selecting one of the option available from the list near the 3D transform manipulator\nwidget.\n\n![Pivot Change](../images/posts/blender-change-pivot-objects-1.jpg)\n\nThat's all for selection and transform of objects. In the next post we will start to explore the art of modeling in\nBlender.\n","slug":"/2018/02/17/blender-tutorial-2-selecting-transforming-objects/","description":"Second post of the Blender tutorial series.

In this post we will continue to explore the capabilities of Blender by analyzing\noutliner, layers, groups, hierarchies and scenes.  \nLet's start from the **outliner**. This one contains the complete list of the objects contained in the scene. Each on of\nthem is represented with its material and geometry. It is possible to rename a mesh by *right clicking* on it and\nchoosing *rename*. To the right of each mesh we have the *restriction column*. It contains 3 buttons:\n\n* *the first button let us hide meshes in the 3D window*\n* *the second button let us set a mesh as not selectable*\n* *the third button let us hide meshes from the final renderer*\n\n![The outliner](../images/posts/blender-outliner.jpg)\n\nNow let's talk about **layers**. We can find the layer panel at the bottom of the 3D window. Each layer is represented\nwith a button similar to a checkbox. We can turn on/off a layer by clicking on their corresponding button. We can add a\nmesh to a specific layer by selecting the layer and creating the mesh we want (primitive or import it). We can also move\nlayer by using the *m key* shortcut or by using the menu *Object -> Move to layer*.\n\n![The layers panel](../images/posts/blender-layers.jpg)\n\nAnother way to organize our objects is by using **groups**. With groups you can select multiple objects at once. We can\ncreate groups and add an object to an existing group by using the menu in the property panel or by using the *ctrl + g\nkeys* shortcut.\n\n![Groups, a way to select multiple object at once](../images/posts/blender-groups.jpg)\n\nAfter layers and group we have **scenes**. Scenes allow us to create different set of our objects or new set with new\nobject inside our project. We can create and manage scenes by using the outliner and the ad hoc menu at the top of the\n3D window. We can create scenes that:\n\n* are linked together: this means that a modification to one mesh in a scenes will be reflected also in the other.\n* separated scene: this means that a modification to one mesh in a scenes will NOT be reflected also in the other.\n\n![An example of a Blender scene](../images/posts/blender-scene.jpg)\n\nLast but not least we have **hierarchies**. We can create hierarchies of objects by selecting them and by choosing *\nObject ->  Parent*. Here we can find all the possible type of parental relationships that we can create. After creating\na hierarchies of objects, they will be shown grouped in the outliner. We will use hierarchies extensively when we will\ntalk about animation.\n\n![Hierarchies of objects](../images/posts/blender-hierarchies.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will talk about materials.\n","slug":"/2018/10/18/blender-tutorial-6-outliner-layers-groups-hierarchies-scenes/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about outliner, layers, groups, hierarchies and scenes.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"1db161e4-5cdb-5a37-aa46-02cc99b0ddba":{"title":"Web to native code communication on iOS using WKScriptMessageHandler","content":"\n*Did you know that it is possible to call Swift code from the JavaScript code of a web page displayed inside a\nWKWebView?*\n\n---\n\nSooner or later every mobile developer in the world had the following specific need: integrate a website page inside an\napp. Usually the integration to be developed requires a deep integration between web and native: the app must react to\nsome changes in the web page based on the user interactions or some other events (automatic refresh, geolocation etc.).\nThe old way to do this integration was to catch some url change/page load using the classical UIWebView delegate\nmethods. But starting from iOS 8 (this is old but gold :trophy::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) there's a better way to\ndo this integration using `WKWebView`s and `WKScriptMessageHandler`. In this post I will show you how is it possible to\nuse them to call Swift code from Javascript code inside a webpage.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nSuppose for example we have a simple html page that contains a form with 2 input fields and a button. We want to be able\nto read the form data inserted when the user clicks on the button and do some action on the Swift code side. In this\nsample case we will show a simple `UIAlertController` that contains the form data.  \nLet's start by setting up the controller that will display the form, `FormViewController`. The first thing to do is to\nsetup the `WKWebView` and add it to the main `UIView` of our controller. After that we can already setup the code that\nwill load the web page in the function `loadPage` (in this case, to keep the example as simple as possible, the webpage\nis loaded from a local file in the `Bundle`).\n\n```swift\nclass FormViewController: UIViewController {\n    private var wkWebView: WKWebView!\n\n    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        self.setupWKWebview()\n        self.loadPage()\n    }\n\n    private func setupWKWebview() {\n        self.wkWebView = WKWebView(frame: self.view.bounds, configuration: self.getWKWebViewConfiguration())\n        self.view.addSubview(self.wkWebView)\n    }\n\n    private func loadPage() {\n        if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \"form\", withExtension: \"html\") {\n            self.wkWebView.load(URLRequest(url: url))\n        }\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe code is pretty basic here. The important thing that you can see in the piece of code above is the call to\na `getWKWebViewConfiguration` method. Let's see the implementation of this method.\n\n```swift\nclass FormViewController: UIViewController, WKScriptMessageHandler {\n\n    ...\n\n    private func getWKWebViewConfiguration() -> WKWebViewConfiguration {\n        let userController = WKUserContentController()\n        userController.add(self, name: \"observer\")\n        let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n        configuration.userContentController = userController\n        return configuration\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThis is where the \"magic binding\" between the Javascript code and the native side happens. In fact, by setting\nthe `FormViewController` as `WKScriptMessageHandler` using the `WKUserContentController`, we will receive each message\nthat is send from the webpage using the message handler `window.webkit.messageHandlers.observer`. As you can\nsee, `observer` is the name that we specified in the `WKUserContentController` configuration during its creation.  \nAfter the setup we can implement the `WKScriptMessageHandler` protocol\nmethod `userContentController(_ userContentController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage)`\nand decide what to do with the form data received. In this case I decided that the message that we will receive will\nhave the following structure:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  name: '<a name>',\n    email\n:\n  '<an email>'\n}\n```\n\nThis message will be converted to a Swift `Dictionary` and will be put in the `body` of the `WKScriptMessage` received\nby the `WebKit` SDK. So we can proceed with the unwrap of each property of this dictionary and show them in\na `UIAlertViewController`. Below you can find the final implementation of the `FormViewController`.\n\n```swift\nclass FormViewController: UIViewController, WKScriptMessageHandler {\n    private var wkWebView: WKWebView!\n\n    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        self.setupWKWebview()\n        self.loadPage()\n    }\n\n    private func setupWKWebview() {\n        self.wkWebView = WKWebView(frame: self.view.bounds, configuration: self.getWKWebViewConfiguration())\n        self.view.addSubview(self.wkWebView)\n    }\n\n    private func loadPage() {\n        if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \"form\", withExtension: \"html\") {\n            self.wkWebView.load(URLRequest(url: url))\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func getWKWebViewConfiguration() -> WKWebViewConfiguration {\n        let userController = WKUserContentController()\n        userController.add(self, name: \"observer\")\n        let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n        configuration.userContentController = userController\n        return configuration\n    }\n\n    func userContentController(_ userContentController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {\n        if let data = message.body as? [String : String], let name = data[\"name\"], let email = data[\"email\"] {\n            showUser(email: email, name: name)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func showUser(email: String, name: String) {\n        let userDescription = \"\\(email) \\(name)\"\n        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: \"User\", message: userDescription, preferredStyle: .alert)\n        alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: \"OK\", style: .default))\n        present(alertController, animated: true)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's see now the implementation of the web page. It will contain a standard html form. We attach a call to\na `submitForm` Javascript function that will get the data from the form (using standard `getElementById` calls) and\nconstruct the message to be sent. After that, we can send the message with the\ncall `window.webkit.messageHandlers.observer.postMessage(message)`. Below you can find the complete implementation of\nthe web page.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" />\n  <title>ExploreWKWebViewJavascript</title>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    function submitForm() {\n      var message = {\n        name: document.getElementById(\"name\").value,\n        email: document.getElementById(\"email\").value\n      };\n      window.webkit.messageHandlers.observer.postMessage(message);\n    }\n  </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div>\n  <h2>Enter your data:</h2>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n    <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter email\" name=\"email\">\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"name  \">Name:</label>\n    <input type=\"value\" id=\"name\" placeholder=\"Enter name\" name=\"name\">\n  </div>\n  <button onclick=\"submitForm()\">Click me</button>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nOne important thing to note: `window.webkit.messageHandlers` is expose on the `window` as a global object only when your\npage is displayed on a iOS device inside a `WKWebView`. This means that if you're planning to show your webpage with\nthis kind of binding also on other platform, you will need to implement a guard on the `webkit.messageHandlers` object.\nYou can find the complete example in\nthis [github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Explore-WKScriptMessageHandler \"WKScriptMessageHandler github repository\").\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe `WKWebView` and the `WKScriptMessageHandler` are really powerful. They let you implement a deeper web to native\nintegration that could significantly improve the general user experiences. `WKScriptMessageHandler`, another useful tool\nin the toolbox of every iOS Developer :iphone:.\n","slug":"/2019/08/03/html-javascript-to-native-communication-ios/","description":"Did you know that it is possible to call Swift/Objective-C code from the JavaScript code of a web page displayed inside a WKWebView?","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"1f83cb6c-649d-5a7a-8814-d6a89578be35":{"title":"About Me","content":"\n*It's me, Fabrizio Duroni. A software developer with a true passion for his work. A computer graphics lover. But wait,\nanother blog yet? Yes, you're right, it could be boring. I hope this will not be my case.*\n\n---\n\nHello! I'm Fabrizio Duroni. I live in Como, Italy with my family, my girlfriend Chiara and a lot of computers. I started\nto love technology since I was 7 years old, when I received my\nfirst [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy \"Game Boy\") for Christmas. I still remember the first day I\nplayed to [Super Mario Land 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land_2:_6_Golden_Coins \"Super Mario Land 2\").\nIt was really amazing.\n\n![The game boy and the cover of my first video game: Super Mario Land 2](../images/posts/game-boy.jpg \"One of my \nfavourite game\")\n\nI continued my journey with another console,\nthe [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System \"Nintendo NES\"). Just to be clear (if you\ndidn't get it yet), video games are one of main hobbies. After the first two Nintendo console, I became a Playstation\nFan and I bought every console Sony has been release since the first one in 1995.  \nI bought my first pc when I was 10 years old. It was equipped with an AMD K5 (NO INTEL PENTIUM?!!! :open_mouth:)\nprocessor and 64 MB of RAM. I remember the first experiments with it and how fun it was to discover new things about\ncomputer science every day.  \nI started to study programming since I was 14. I started with Pascal during High School and then I continued with **C,\nJava, PHP** during my bachelor's degree. In 2009 I fell in love with Apple :iphone: (what??!!!! :laughing:), and I\nstarted to develop iOS application in 2010. As a result you can understand why I'm in love with **Swift** and **\nObjective-C**. This was also the time when started my *internal struggle* about which one is the best between Apple and\nMicrosoft, without forgetting, of course, of Linux (and I don't think this internal fight will never end :sweat_smile:).\n\n![The never ending struggle: Apple vs Microsoft vs Linux](../images/posts/apple-microsoft-linux.jpg)\n\nIn 2013 I started my master degree, where I studied in **computer graphics**, the computer science field I love the\nmost. This is why I also fell in love with **C++**. I also know **Javascript** and **TypeScript**.  \nIf you want to read other details about my computer science journey, see my [homepage](/ \"homepage\").  \nI consider myself an experienced developer. I enjoy so much my work. I consider it as a way to challenge myself every\nday and it also gives me the possibility to get in touch with a lot of very smart people.\n\n### **By the way, what does it mean Chicio?**\n\nChicio is my nickname as long as I could remember. Everyone is used to call me in this way. Sometimes I think this is my\nreal name. Its origin will remain unknown (to you... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:), but I really like it.\n\n### **Why do you want to start a blog?**\n\nJust for selfish reasons. Mainly because I want to keep track of my progress in programming, computer graphics and\ngenerally speaking in everything related to computer science. That's it.\n\n### **What is the logo image near the blog name?**\n\nIt's an image of the [Sombrero Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_Galaxy \"Sombrero galaxy\"). You can find an\nimage of this galaxy also on the cover\nof [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://cleancoders.com \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\")\nby Robert C. Martin \"Uncle Bob\". I'm getting deep into the clean code world while I'm starting this blog and I think I\nwill talk a lot also about this topic.\n\n![Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin](../images/posts/clean-code-uncle-bob.jpg)\n\n### **Is there something after Computer Science?**\n\nObviously Chiara, the most important person in my life :cupid:.  \nThere was a time when I was a huge metal :metal: and rock music fan. I tried to play bass guitar for some years, but I\nfailed miserably (really, it's not my job :grin:). In fact, I have on my skin \"the signatures\" (tattoos!!) from that\nperiod. Now I enjoy a more \"open relation\" with music without too much stress (but I eventually hope in the near future\nto start again to make some signatures on my skin :relieved:). I also really like to go with my bicycle. I could say I'm\nsome sort of sportsman.\n\nThe presentation is over, and I hope you're not already bored.  \nEnjoy the read.\n","slug":"/2017/05/10/about-me/","description":"Fabrizio Duroni","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"252d32ef-91e0-5a73-a29a-ae6f5cea5aae":{"title":"Contract testing asynchronous messaging with Pact and MockK","content":"\n*In the last weeks I worked with my colleague Felice Giovinazzo on a new feature for the refund\nprocess. Let’s see how we used pact to test a message-based interaction between two microservices with Pact*\n\n---\n\nIn the last weeks I worked with my colleague [Felice Giovinazzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felice-giovinazzo-17277b55/) \non a new feature for the refund process (as may already know from some of\n[my previous posts](/2020/12/23/rest-template-webclient-spring-boot/ \"kotlin spring boot\") in the last 2 years I \nworked mainly on backend applications). In this new feature we have a messaging-based communication between\nmicroservices. The messaging system used is [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com \"rabbitmq\"). In \n[lastminute.com group](https://www.lastminute.com) we are already using [Pact](https://docs.pact.io \"pact doc\") to \nimplement contract testing for the classic RESTful interaction between microservices. What is contract testing? \nLet’s have a look at the definition from the Pact website.\n\n> Contract tests assert that inter-application messages conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a \n> contract. Without contract testing, the only way to ensure that applications will work correctly together is by \n> using expensive and brittle integration tests.  \n> Do you [set your house on fire to test your smoke alarm?](https://dius.com.au/2014/05/19/simplifying-micro-service-testing-with-pacts/) \n> No, you test the contract it holds with your ears by using the testing button. Pact provides that testing button \n> for your code, allowing you to safely confirm that your applications will work together without having to deploy \n> the world first.\n\nSo contract testing is a way to ensure that two application communicate correctly by adhering to a contract that\ndescribe the API or the message exchanged between them. Cool, isn’t it? 😏\n\n![contract testing pact](../images/posts/pact-contract-testing.jpg \"Pact contract testing\")\n\nIn this post I will show you how me and Felice tested a messaging interaction between two microservices using Pact with \nthe help of [Stefano Varesi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanovaresi/), a senior software engineer that works in \nthe lastminute.com team that introduced Pact in the company. How does it work? Pact is a [consumer driven contract testing](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html\n\"consumer driven contract testing\"): it is responsibility of the consumer to generate the contract that will be used by\nthe provider to verify its correctness. As you can see from the image above, there are three key actors in pact test:\n\n* the consumer of an API\n* the provider of an API\n* a pact broker, an application used to share contracts and verification results between consumers and providers.\n\nThe workflow to write a consumer driven contract test is the following one:\n\n* write the contract test on the consumer\n* publish the contract obtained by executing the contract test on the consumer side\n* write the provider test using the contract published before as a proof of correctness of your API\n\nThe same flow is applied in case of a message/event driven architecture: start with the test of the message consumer,\npublish the contract and then write the message producer test. Now that everything is clear we can start to write our\nfirst Pact test for message exchange between two microservices. Let’s go!!! 🚀\n\n#### Setup\n\nOur example application is composed by two microservices:\n\n* `RefundService`, a spring boot web application that manages everything related to the refund of an order of a\n  customer. In our example this application will be the *producer* of a *refund ready message*.\n* `AccountService`, a spring boot web application that manages everything related to the customer account. In our\n  example this application will be the *consumer* of a *refund ready message* that came from the `RefundService`\n  application.\n\nLet's see the dependencies need by these applications. Both of them will depend on these libraries/languages:\n\n* spring boot, kotlin, [arrow](https://arrow-kt.io \"arrow kotlin\") (kotlin functional programming library)\n  production code\n* spring boot starter test, [kotest](https://kotest.io) and [mockk](https://mockk.io) for the testing part\n\nFor writing our Pact test:\n\n* `RefundService` will have the dependency needed in order to write the pact provider\n  test `au.com. dius.pact.provider.junit5`\n* `AccountService` will have the dependency needed in order to write the pact consumer\n  test `au.com.dius.pact. consumer.junit5`\n\nIn the `AccountService` application, so on the consumer side, we need also to set up the maven\nplugin `au.com.dius. pact.provider.maven` that will let us publish our contracts on the pact broker. Below you can find\nthe maven pom.xml of the applications.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"

For our example we can create a local instance using the docker compose file\ncontained in the [pact broker official repo](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-broker-docker#running-with-docker-compose). Obviously for a real \nproduction case you need to host your broker somewhere in your environment. The services initialized in the docker \ncompose file include:\n\n* the pact broker PostgreSQL database instance\n* the pact broker web app\n* a nginx instance used as reverse proxy (in fact if you want to use/keep it in the docker compose file you have to \n  download from the pact broker repository also the self-signed certificate used for TLS). \n\nBelow you can find the entire docker compose file. \n\n```dockerfile\nversion: \"3\"\n\nservices:\n  postgres:\n    image: postgres\n    healthcheck:\n      test: psql postgres --command \"select 1\" -U postgres\n    volumes:\n      - postgres-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_USER: postgres\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password\n      POSTGRES_DB: postgres\n\n  pact-broker:\n    image: pactfoundation/pact-broker:2.89.0.0\n    ports:\n      - \"9292:9292\"\n    depends_on:\n      - postgres\n    environment:\n      PACT_BROKER_PORT: '9292'\n      PACT_BROKER_DATABASE_URL: \"postgres://postgres:password@postgres/postgres\"\n      PACT_BROKER_LOG_LEVEL: INFO\n      PACT_BROKER_SQL_LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG\n      # PACT_BROKER_DATABASE_CONNECT_MAX_RETRIES is only needed for docker-compose\n      # because the database takes longer to start up than the puma process\n      # Should not be needed in production.\n      PACT_BROKER_DATABASE_CONNECT_MAX_RETRIES: \"5\"\n      # The list of allowed base URLs (not setting this makes the app vulnerable to cache poisoning)\n      # This allows the app to be addressed from the host from within another docker container correctly\n      PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL: 'https://localhost http://localhost http://localhost:9292 http://pact-broker:9292'\n\n  # Nginx is not necessary, but demonstrates how\n  # one might use a reverse proxy in front of the broker,\n  # and includes the use of a self-signed TLS certificate\n  nginx:\n    image: nginx:alpine\n    depends_on:\n      - pact-broker\n    volumes:\n      - ./ssl/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro\n      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl\n    ports:\n      - \"443:443\"\n      - \"80:80\"\nvolumes:\n  postgres-volume: \n```\n\nWe can build all the containers defined in it with the docker compose commands below.\n\n```shell\ndocker-compose build\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nAfter running the commands above we will have a pact broker local instance. We can access it in the browser \n(as localhost) and below you can see the homepage with an example contract listed. We are now ready to write our test.\n\n![pact broker](../images/posts/pact-broker-homepage.jpg \"Pact broker homepage\")\n\n#### Implementation\n\nAs we said in the introduction, we are using the consumer driven contract test approch. This means that for our \nexample we will start from `AccountService`, the message consumer. In this microservice we have a \n`RefundReadyMessageConsumer`, that consume the message received from `RefundService`. Inside this class we have two \ncollaborator:\n\n* `RefundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor`, a collaborator that extract the payload from the message received\n* `SendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase`, a use case that uses the payload information to send a communication to \n  the user\n\nThe payload of the message, represented by the `RefundReadyMessage` data class is very simple. It contains the id \nthat identify the refund due to the user and the relative amount (represented as a combination of value and currency).\n\n```kotlin\ndata class Money(\n    val value: BigDecimal,\n    val currency: String\n)\n\ndata class RefundReadyMessage(\n    val refundId: Long,\n    val amount: Money\n)\n\ninterface RefundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor {\n    fun extract(message: String): Either<CantExtractMessage, RefundReadyMessage>\n}\n\nobject RefundCommunicationSent\n\ninterface SendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase {\n    fun execute(refundReadyMessage: RefundReadyMessage): Either<CantCommunicateRefund, RefundCommunicationSent>\n}\n\nsealed class RefundReadyMessageConsumerError {\n    object CantExtractMessage: RefundReadyMessageConsumerError()\n    object CantCommunicateRefund: RefundReadyMessageConsumerError()\n}\n\nclass RefundReadyMessageConsumer(\n    private val refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor: RefundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor,\n    private val sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase: SendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase\n) {\n    fun consume(message: String): Either<RefundReadyMessageConsumerError, RefundCommunicationSent> =\n        refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor\n            .extract(message)\n            .flatMap { refundReadyMessage ->\n                sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase.execute(refundReadyMessage)\n            }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see our example consumer application is very simple. Let's start to write the consumer Pact test for our \n`RefundReadyMessageConsumer`. We create a new test class `RefundReadyMessageConsumerPactTest`. First we need to add \nsome annotations:\n\n* `@ExtendWith(PactConsumerTestExt::class, MockKExtension::class)` to add the Pact and \n  MockK [JUnit 5 extensions](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions), in order to be able to \n  use the Pact and MockK capabilities in our test. \n* `@PactTestFor(providerName = \"refund-service\", providerType = ProviderType.ASYNCH)`, to tell the Pact extension \n  how to set up the Pact test. In our case we are defining a provider named `refund-service` of type `ProviderType.\n  ASYNCH`.\n\nThen we need to mock the collaborator of our consumer `refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor` and \n`sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase`. We can do it by using the `@MockK` annotation. Now we are ready to write \nour pact. We can do it by adding a new method `refundReadyMessagePact` annotated with the `@Pact(consumer = \"account-service\", provider = \n\"refund-service\")` annotation. In this method we will define a pact where we expect to receive a message, \nrepresented in our test as an instance of `MessagePact`, that contains the data we listed above \n(refund id, and amount). The two actors of our pact are `refund-service` and `account-service`. The first one will \nsend us a message `\"a refund ready to be sent to the user\"`, stated by the `given` method of the \n`MessagePactBuilder` class, and we expect to receive `\"the refund data to be communicated\"`, stated by the \n`expectsToReceive` method (again of the`MessagePactBuilder` class). The payload of the message is represented as \ninstance of `PactDslJsonBody`.  \nNow we can write our test to receive that we are consuming the message in the right way. To do this we need to \ncreate a new test method annotaed with the standard `@Test` JUnit 5 annotation. We need also to add the `@PactTestFor\n(pactMethod = \"refundReadyMessagePact\")`, that instruct the Pact extension to inject the `MessagePact` generated \nfrom the pact created by the `refundReadyMessagePact` method we talked about before. So the signature of the test \nwill have `messages: List<Message>` parameter with the list of message we defined in our pact (in our case it is \njust one message). We can now instruct the mocks and write our assertions on the result of the `consume` method of our \n`RefundReadyMessageConsumer`. At this point we should have a green test like the one below, and it should be already \ngreen :white_check_mark: :smirk:.\n\n```kotlin\n@ExperimentalUnsignedTypes\n@ExtendWith(PactConsumerTestExt::class, MockKExtension::class)\n@PactTestFor(providerName = \"refund-service\", providerType = ProviderType.ASYNCH)\nclass RefundReadyMessageConsumerPactTest {\n    @MockK\n    private lateinit var refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor: RefundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor\n    @MockK\n    private lateinit var sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase: SendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase\n\n    @Pact(consumer = \"account-service\", provider = \"refund-service\")\n    fun refundReadyMessagePact(builder: MessagePactBuilder): MessagePact {\n        return builder\n            .given(\"a refund ready to be sent to the user\")\n            .hasPactWith(\"refund-service\")\n            .expectsToReceive(\"the refund data to be communicated\")\n            .withContent(\n                PactDslJsonBody()\n                    .numberType(\"refundId\", 123)\n                    .`object`(\n                        \"amount\",\n                        PactDslJsonBody()\n                            .numberType(\"value\", 100)\n                            .stringType(\"currency\", \"EUR\")\n                    )\n            )\n            .toPact()\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    @PactTestFor(pactMethod = \"refundReadyMessagePact\")\n    fun `consume refund ready message`(messages: List<Message>) {\n        every {\n            refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor.extract(\"{\\\"amount\\\":{\\\"currency\\\":\\\"EUR\\\",\\\"value\\\":100},\\\"refundId\\\":123}\")\n        } returns refundReadyMessage.right()\n        every {\n            sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase.execute(refundReadyMessage)\n        } returns RefundCommunicationSent.right()\n\n        RefundReadyMessageConsumer(refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor, sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase)\n            .consume(messages[0].contentsAsString()) shouldBe RefundCommunicationSent.right()\n\n        verify(exactly = 1) {\n            refundReadyMessagePayloadExtractor.extract(\"{\\\"amount\\\":{\\\"currency\\\":\\\"EUR\\\",\\\"value\\\":100},\\\"refundId\\\":123}\")\n            sendCommunicationForRefundReadyUseCase.execute(refundReadyMessage)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private companion object {\n        private val refundReadyMessage = RefundReadyMessage(123, Money(BigDecimal(\"100\"), \"EUR\"))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow that our test is ready and green, how can we publish the contract to the Pact Broker? If we have a look at the \n`target` folder of our application after running the test, we will find a new `pacts` folder that contains a json \nnamed `account-service-refund-service.json`: this is our contract!!! :rocket: If you remember the introduction set up,\nwe installed a plugin in order to publish the contract to the broker. So the only thing we have to do is launch the \nfollowing command and the contract will be published on the pact broker.\n\n```shell\nmvn pact:publish\n```\n\n![pact publish example](../images/posts/pact-publish-example.jpg \"Pact publish example\")\n\nIf we reload the pact broker homepage now we should see a new contract, the one we just published, with all the data \nneeded by the provider to verify its payload. Below you can see a screenshot of the pact broker that show our new \ncontract.\n\n![pact broker contract message example](../images/posts/pact-broker-homepage.jpg \"Our Pact broker contract message \npage\")\n\nNow we can write our provider test. Let's see first the `RefundService` codebase. As our consumer, it is very simple.\nWe have a `RefundReadyMessageProducer` that produce a Refund Ready message as a string. It uses `RefundRepository` \nas collaborator to get the information about the refund of a user, represented as a `Refund` data class (again with \nid and amount of the refund).\n\n```kotlin\ndata class Money(\n    val value: BigDecimal,\n    val currency: String\n)\n\ndata class Refund(\n    val refundId: Long,\n    val amount: Money\n)\n\ninterface RefundRepository {\n    fun get(refundId: Long): Either<RefundReadyMessageProducerError.RefundRepositoryError, Refund>\n}\n\nsealed class RefundReadyMessageProducerError {\n    object RefundRepositoryError : RefundReadyMessageProducerError()\n}\n\nclass RefundReadyMessageProducer(\n    private val refundRepository: RefundRepository,\n) {\n    fun produceFor(refundId: Long): Either<RefundReadyMessageProducerError, String> =\n        refundRepository\n            .get(refundId)\n            .flatMap {\n                jacksonObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(it).right()\n            }\n}\n```\n\nLet's write our `RefundReadyMessageProducerTest`. As for the consumer, we need the `@ExtendWith\n(MockKExtension::class)` to be able to use MockK as mocking framework. Then we have some Pact annotations and methods. \nThese are needed in order to use the JUnit 5 Invocation Context Provider that will generate a test for each \ninteraction found for the pact files for the provider. The annotations are:\n\n* `@Provider(\"refund-service\")`, to defined which provider we are\n* `@Consumer(\"account-service\")`, to define who is our consumer\n* `@PactBroker(host = \"localhost\", port = \"80\")`, to define the location of the pact broker\n\nThen we have the `testTemplate` and `before` methods that completes our setup. As you can see the target of our \n`PactVerificationContext` is of type `MessageTestTarget`. One important thing: in the constructor of \n`MessageTestTarget` we are passing the `packagesToScan = listOf(this::class.java.packageName)` parameter in order to \nlet Pact search for pact methods (see below `@PactVerifyProvide`) only in the package of the class under test.\n\n```kotlin\n//...\n\n@TestTemplate\n@ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider::class)\nfun testTemplate(pact: Pact, interaction: Interaction, context: PactVerificationContext) {\n    context.verifyInteraction()\n}\n\n@BeforeEach\nfun before(context: PactVerificationContext) {\n    context.target = MessageTestTarget(packagesToScan = listOf(this::class.java.packageName))\n}\n\n//...\n```\n\nAt this point we can write our test. If you remember from the consumer test we defined a `given` section of our pact \nwith the phrase `\"a refund ready to be sent to the user\"` and a `expectsToReceive` with the phrase `\"the refund data to be communicated\"`. These phrases \nare used as identifier by the `@State(\"a refund ready to be sent to the user\")` and `@PactVerifyProvider(\"the refund \ndata to be communicated\")` annotation to understand which pact we are verifying. We can now just write our test by \nmocking our repository and let our producer return the message produced: Pact will do all the verification between \nthe message we are generating in the test and the one contained in the contract. \n\n```kotlin\n@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)\n@Provider(\"refund-service\")\n@Consumer(\"account-service\")\n@PactBroker(host = \"localhost\", port = \"80\")\nclass RefundReadyMessageProducerTest {\n    @MockK\n    private lateinit var refundRepository: RefundRepository\n\n    @TestTemplate\n    @ExtendWith(PactVerificationInvocationContextProvider::class)\n    fun testTemplate(pact: Pact, interaction: Interaction, context: PactVerificationContext) {\n        context.verifyInteraction()\n    }\n\n    @BeforeEach\n    fun before(context: PactVerificationContext) {\n        context.target = MessageTestTarget(packagesToScan = listOf(this::class.java.packageName))\n    }\n\n    @State(\"a refund ready to be sent to the user\")\n    @PactVerifyProvider(\"the refund data to be communicated\")\n    fun `produce refund ready message`(): String {\n        every {\n            refundRepository.get(123)\n        } returns Refund(\n            123,\n            Money(\n                BigDecimal(100),\n                \"EUR\"\n            )\n        ).right()\n\n        return RefundReadyMessageProducer(refundRepository)\n            .produceFor(123)\n            .fold(\n                { \"invalid message\" },\n                { it }\n            )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAt this point we should have a green test also on the provider, and our contract between our producer and consumer \nis verified!!! :rocket:\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find the example described in this post in this \n[Github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Contract-Testing-Asynchronous-Messaging-Pact). As we saw from the \nexample above Pact is a powerful testing tool. It lets you write consumer driven contract test that are faster than \nall the E2E/integration testing tools you can use in your application. But most important Pact gives you the ability \nto refactor the design of an API/message in a safe and controlled way :passport_control: :heart_eyes:. \n","slug":"/2021/11/05/contract-testing-asynchronous-messaging-pact-junit-mockk/","description":"In the last weeks I worked with my colleague Felice Giovinazzo on a new feature for the refund  process.

A\nseries of tutorial for beginners/newbies (like me).*\n\n---\n\nIf you like computer graphics, at some point during your studies you will want to learn to use a 3D content creation\nsoftware. That's why I started to study Blender, the most beautiful and famous open source 3D software available for\nfree in the market. In this series of posts I will guide you through its features with some tutorials and references\nlist. At the time of this writing the available version of Bender used for this tutorials is the 2.79. All the tutorials\nare written using Blender on a MacBook Pro. Let's start from the user interface.\n\nThe default layout is composed of individual panels, and inside each one of them we can find an editor. The main editors\nare:\n\n* **info editor**, in the top left part of the screen. It contains the main menu of Blender. It contains also a layout\n  switcher, to quickly change the layout of Blender based on our needs (animation, modeling...) and a renderer switcher,\n  to select the renderer engine.\n* **outliner editor**, it contains a list of all the objects in the scene.\n* **properties editor**, it contains the properties of an object. It is context specific, so its content will change\n  accordingly to the selected object. It contains also a lot of context specific tabs with specific properties for\n  different context.\n* **timeline and animation editor**, used to create and modify animation\n* **viewport**, that contains the 3D window in which our scene is shown and where we can add, remove or modify objects.\n\n![Blender editors](../images/posts/blender-ui-1-editors.jpg)\n\nWe can switch a panel from one editor to another by clicking on the icon that shows the current editor selected: a list\nwith all the available editors will be shown and we can choose one of them.\n\n![The switch editor](../images/posts/blender-ui-2-switch-editor.jpg)\n\nOn the left side of the viewport we can find a series of tabs that contain some operations, tools and actions we can\napply to the 3D window content. This tabs will change based on the fact that we selected or not an object and also based\non which type of object we selected. We can also show the object properties sub-panel by clicking the plus (+) button on\nthe right. That sub-panel gives us some information about the object we selected in the 3D window.  \nAt the bottom of the 3D window we can find the 3D manipulator widget, that allows us to scale, rotate and translate\nobject with the mouse drag.  \nThen we have the layer switcher, that will let us create layered scene (we will talk about layers in a future post).  \nWe have also the viewport shading button, that let use choose the desired type of visualization we want for our scene:\n\n* **bounding box**\n* **wireframe**\n* **solid**, that shows also colors of the objects\n* **texture mode**, that shows also textures of the objects\n* **materials**, that let us adds the materials to our objects\n* **rendered**\n\nFinally we have the editing interaction mode selector, that allow us to switch between editing mode:\n\n* **object mode**, that allow us to deal with individual objects\n* **edit mode**, that allow us to change the objects\n\nThe menus on the left of the editing mode selector will change accordingly to the mode selected.\n\n![The 3D window editor](../images/posts/blender-ui-3-3Dwindow.jpg)\n\nTo navigate in the 3D space, usually Blender require a 3 button mouse (we will see below how to emulate a 3 buttons\nmouse). Anyway, as we're on a MacBook pro we can do the following basic operation with the \"alternative\" default\nmapping:\n\n* **orbit around** in the scene by *dragging with two fingers*\n* **zoom in/out** in the scene with *pinch and zoom*\n* **pan** in the scene with *shift + drag with two fingers*\n\nThere are also some other basic useful 3D navigation commands:\n\n* align view to cursor and show all objects with *shift + \"c\"* (or alternatively in object mode *View -> Align View ->\n  Center Cursor*)\n* align view to one side with the options *Left, Right, Top, Bottom, Front, Back* contained in the *View menu*\n* change between orthographic and perspective view with the menu option *View -> View Persp/Ortho*\n\nYou can change the user preferences by going to *File -> User Preferences*. Here you can modify settings for:\n\n* **Interface**, so what Blender should show in the interface\n* **Editing**, so how we edit objects\n* **Input**, how mouse and keyboard are configured\n* **Add-ons**, where you can manage plugins\n* **Themes**, to change the color of the interface\n* **File**, to configure standard paths\n* **System**, for system specific settings\n\nTo be noted is the option \"Emulate 3 Button mouse\" in the input settings. This option let Blender emulates a 3 button\nmouse using the Alt button. Int this way you can use this setting to use Blender with standard keys for mouse.  \nThat's enough first post.

Everyone in the computer graphics field know it is the future. I\nwill talk a lot about it in some future post. But now, for this first post about computer graphics theory, I would like\nto talk about one of the most popular lighting model used in computer graphics: the Phong reflection post.  \nWhy? Because even if PBR is winning the war (I know you're scared about PBR theoretical foundation :fearful: :\nstuck_out_tongue:), the Phong reflection model is still used in a lot of application, and it is also a good starting\npoint for everyone who want to start a journey in the computer graphics field. In this post I will show you what it is\nin detail and we will see an implementation in OpenGL ES GLSL shading language. All the vectors reported in this article\nwill be [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector \"unit vector\"). First of all we need to do a\nclassification of the lighting models available in computer graphics. The light at any give point on a surface in a\nscene is influenced by:\n\n* Direct illumination: light directly arriving on the surface\n* Indirect illumination: light arriving on the surface after having bounced off other surfaces\n\nAs a consequence of this fact lighting methods can be:\n\n* Local models: only the direct illumination is considered\n* Global models: both direct and indirect illuminations are considered\n\nThe Phong reflection model is an empirical (so based on observations) local illumination model. Let's see how we is it\ncomposed. In real world light is modeled by its spectrum, and each surface by its reflectance spectrum. In computer\ngraphics often an approximation based on RGB triplets is used:\n\n* Light color is a RGB triplet\n* The reflectance spectrum is a triple of percentage\n\nSo each component of the following equations will be described by a triplet of number (RGB or percentage).  \nThe light that you see on a surface could be decomposed into four main components. Let's see them in detail and how they\nare composed together to calculate the illumination of a surface point: Phong model.\n\n#### **Emissive component**\n\nThis is the light component emitted by the surface material. Is a purely additive component. As you can image, few\nsurface material in nature are emissive (e.g.: light  :laughing:). So the emissive illumination $I_{\\text{emissive}}$ of\na surface point is obtained by multiplying the emissive constant of a surface $k_{\\text{e}}$ by the light emissive\nintensity $I_{\\text{LE}}$ (expressed as we said before as a RGB triplet, and this will be valid for all light intensity\ndefine in the following formulas of this post). The emissive light intensity could be the intensity of the scene light (\nor an average if you have multiple scene lights): practically speaking you can use the scene light RGB color. The\nemissive constant $k_{\\text{e}}$ is a surface property that express its emissive reflectance.\n\n$$\nI_{\\text{emissive}}=k_{\\text{e}}I_{\\text{LE}}\n$$\n\n#### **Ambient component**\n\nThis is light component used to model empirically the contribution of indirect illumination of bouncing lights in the\nscene on a surface. It depends entirely on the surface material (no geometry influences). So the ambient illumination\n$I_{\\text{ambient}}$ of a surface point is obtained by multiplying the ambient constant of a surface $k_{\\text{a}}$ with\nthe light ambient intensity $I_{\\text{LA}}$. The ambient constant $k_{\\text{a}}$ is a constant related exclusively to\nthe surface material that express empirically its response to indirect illumination. As for the emissive component, the\nambient light intensity could be the intensity of the scene light (or an average if you have multiple scene lights).\n\n$$\nI_{\\text{ambient}}=k_{\\text{a}}I_{\\text{LA}}\n$$\n\n#### **Diffusive component**\n\nThis light component represents the amount of reflected light given an incident light. Lambertian surfaces are\nconsidered: the incident light is equally reflected (with a given amount) in all directions. The amount of reflected\nlight depends on the incident angle of the light with respect to the surface’s normal. The diffuse illumination $I_\n{\\text{diffuse}}$ of a surface point is obtained by multiplying the diffuse surface constant $k_{\\text{d}}$ with the\nlight diffuse intensity $I_{\\text{LD}}$ and with the attenuation factor due to incident light given by the cosine of the\nangle between the light direction and the surface normal $\\cos\\theta$. This last value is the dot product between the\nsurface normal ${\\hat {N}}$ and the light direction ${\\hat {L}}$. So the final formula for the diffuse component is:\n\n$$\nI_{\\text{diffuse}}=k_{\\text{d}}I_{\\text{LD}}({\\hat {L}}\\cdot{\\hat {N}})\n$$\n\n#### **Specular component**\n\nThis light component represents the amount of reflected light in a specific direction (mirror alike reflection). Light\nis reflected in a different way depending on the incident light direction. Shiny materials are the one with a high\nspecular component. The perceived specular light depends on the position of the observer with respect to the surface. In\nparticular, the specular illumination is influenced by $\\cos\\alpha$, that is the cosine of the angle between the\ndirection from the surface point towards the view ${\\hat {V}}$ and the direction that a perfectly reflected ray of light\nwould take from this point on the surface ${\\hat {R}}$. The size of the specular highlights is regulated by a shininess\nconstant $n$, based on the surface material properties. Given all this information the specular component formula\nobtained by multiplying the specular surface constant $k_{\\text{s}}$ with the light specular intensity $I_{\\text{LS}}$\nand with dot product of the reflection direction ${\\hat {R}}$ and the the direction from the surface point towards the\nview ${\\hat {V}}$ squared to the shininess constant $n$:\n\n$$\nI_{\\text{specular}}=k_{\\text{s}}I_{\\text{LS}}({\\hat {R}}\\cdot {\\hat {V}})^{n}\n$$\n\nThe above observation are valid also in case we have multiple lights. The only difference is that the diffuse and\nspecular component are calculated for each light and their sum is the final diffuse and specular component. Now we are\nready to write the complete Phong reflection lighting equation:\n\n$$\nI_{tot}=I_{emissive}+I_{ambient}+\\sum_{p\\;\\in \\;{lights}} (I_{diffuse, p} + I_{specular, p})\n$$\n\nJust a final note: we distinguished different type of light intensity based on the component. In fact most of the time\nthis model is implemented using a single general light intensity triplet for all the component for each light. How can\nyou implement it in a OpenGL ES shader? The following code sample is a simple implementation of this model using RGB\ncolors. It is a fragment shader that could be used to implement per fragment lighting. This basically means that all\nlighting calculation is done in the fragment shader on each fragment (maybe this is material for a new post :\nstuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). It was written using OpenGL ES 3.0 and GLSL 3.0. It uses a single light for all the\ncomponent calculation.\nYou can find the entire code in this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/chicio/d983fff6ff304bd55bebd6ff05a2f9dd).  \nThe following image is an example of the happy buddha Stanford mesh rendered using\nmy [Spectral BRDF explorer](https://github.com/chicio/Spectral-BRDF-Explorer \"Spectral BRDF explorer\") iOS renderer. The\nlighting is (obviously) calculated using the Phong reflection model. The surface simulated is bronze (you can find \nsome constants we discussed\nbefore [here](http://devernay.free.fr/cours/opengl/materials.html \"phong lighting constants\")).

Let's continue our exploration with other useful tool we can use for\nmodeling.  \nLet's start with **Sculpt mode**. We can enable it in the *editing/interaction mode selector* in the bottom bar of the\n3D window. In this mode you can literally sculpt you mesh. It possible to customize the sculpt mode by setting some of\nits properties:\n\n* *radius of the sculpt*\n* *feather of the sculpt, that changes how the sculpt fall-off*\n* *auto smooth*\n* *add/subtract to pull in/out vertices while sculpting*\n\n![Sculpting mode](../images/posts/blender-sculpting.jpg)\n\nSculpt mode supports also paint textures and strokes. But more important it supports symmetry: by selecting and axis any\nchange on one side will be mirrored on the other one.  \nAnother interesting option is the **edge loop modeling**. Basically this means that if we select a edge loop with *alt +\nright click* in edit mode/edge select mode, we can modify the edge loop by using the 3D axis that are shown after the\nselection. The next tool available for modeling is the **extrude tool**. With this tool we can modify our geometry and\nmore details. In particular, we can use it to create branches, legs and other parts that are out of the main body of the\nmesh. We can activate the extrude under *Mesh tools -> Extrude Region/Individual*. The extrude region will push out the\nelements selected as a single block. The extrude individual will extrude the elements selected individually.\n\n![The extrude tool](../images/posts/blender-extrude.jpg)\n\nAnother useful tool that we can use for modeling is **smooth shading**. We can use these to smooth the surface of\nobjects where the polygons of the mesh have too much hard edges. We can find the it under *Tools -> Shading* while an\nobject is selected in Object mode or under *Shading -> Faces/Edges/Vertices* while an object is in Edit mode.\n\n![Smooth shading](../images/posts/blender-smooth-shading.jpg)\n\nThe last tool we can use for some simple modeling is the **subdividing mesh tool**. There are two ways to do\nsubdivision:\n\n* *subdivision of the mesh itself*\n* *subdivision surface*\n\nNow we will look at subdivision of the mesh itself. To do it we need to be in edit mode on the object and select all\nwith the *a key*. We can find the subdivision option under *Tools -> Subdivide*. If we click on that a series of\nsubdivision properties will appear, that let us customize the number of cuts, the smoothness and other minor properties.\n\n![Subdivision of a mesh](../images/posts/blender-subdivision.jpg)\n\nRemember: each number of cuts increment QUADRUPLICATE the number of polygon in your mesh.  \nIn the next chapter we will talk about advanced modeling techniques and tools.\n","slug":"/2018/06/02/blender-tutorial-4-modeling-basics-part-2/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will continue to talk about the fundamental of modeling in Blender.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"4a6acd7d-81b2-5835-8d86-a95696c80eeb":{"title":"Advent of TypeScript 2023: Connect 4 (Day 23)","content":"\n*Connect 4, a classical family Christmas game. Let's see how to tackle it with the TypeScript type system.*\n\n---\n\nThis is the third of the four challenges I liked the most from \"Advent Of TypeScript 2023\" by [TypeHero](https://typehero.dev). \nCheck out the other challenges I liked [here](/2023/12/29/advent-of-typescript-2023-favourite-challenges/ \"advent of typescript 2023 challenges\").\n\n#### The problem\n\nConnect 4, a classical family Christmas game. Let's see how to tackle it with the typescript type system.\nLet's check the rule briefly explained by the guy from TypeHero:\n\n>In case you haven't played it before: Connect 4 is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.\n\nThe goal of the exercise was to implement the `Connect4` type.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe exercise gave me some data structure to use as the basis of my development (as it was in the previous exercises).\nAgain, they were the domain data structures of the Connect 4 game.\nThere was the definition of the chips, of an empty cell and all the possible states of the game.\nThere was also the definition in terms of data structure of the game board and the game itself.\nThe last one was composed by the current board and the current state of the game. \n\n```typescript\ntype Connect4Chips = '🔴' | '🟡';\ntype Connect4EmptyCell = '  ';\ntype Connect4Cell = Connect4Chips | Connect4EmptyCell;\ntype Connect4State = '🔴' | '🟡' | '🔴 Won' | '🟡 Won' | 'Draw';\n\ntype Connect4Board = Connect4Cell[][];\n\ntype Connect4Game = {\n  board: Connect4Board;\n  state: Connect4State;\n};\n\ntype EmptyBoard = [\n  [\"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \"],\n  [\"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \"],\n  [\"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \"],\n  [\"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \"],\n  [\"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \"],\n  [\"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \", \"  \"],\n];\n\ntype NewGame = {\n  board: EmptyBoard;\n  state: \"🟡\";\n};\n```\n\nAs it was for the previous exercises, a list of test cases was available for verifying that the implementation was \ncorrect.\nThe input of each game move to the `Connect4` type, the one asked to be implemented by the exercise, are:\n* the current game\n* the column on which the chip should be placed\nThe current player is contained in the game itself (as we saw before).\n  `Connect4` should return a new game, with the next player or who wan in the game state, and the updated board.\n\n```typescript\ntype

the board where the chip should have been placed, \ngiven the column as parameter.\n`PositionOnBoard` is a type tha given the current board, and the column where the player wants to place is chip,  \nreturns the board position as a tuple of numbers (so it is like a coordinate point on a matrix).\nHow did I calculate the coordinates?\nFor the column it is really easy: is the one received as parameter :laughing:.\nFor the row, I needed to find the first cell not occupied before one with a chip (or the last one if not chips are \npresent on that column).\nTo do this, I created a `RowStatusFor` type that, given a column position and the curren board, loops through all the \nrows and checks if for the current row the `Column` position is occupied:\n\n* if not, it returns the row position\n* if yes, it returns the content of the cell\n\nThis means that `RowStatusFor` returns an array with a mix of numbers and chip element.\nThe highest number in the array is the farest not occupied position for `Column`.\nTo extract this information, I created a `FindLastRowNotOccupied` type, that scans the array created from \n`RowStatusFor` type (`ColumnStatus`), and returns `LastFreeCell`.\n`LastFreeCell` is a parameter of `FindLastRowNotOccupied`, and is updated on each recursion iteration through the\n`RowStatusFor` array with the current not occupied cell.   \n\n```typescript\ntype ToInt<StringToBeConverted> = StringToBeConverted extends `${infer StringContent extends number}` \n  ? StringContent \n  : never;\n\ntype RowStatusFor<Column extends number, CurrentBoard extends Connect4Board> = {\n  [Row in keyof CurrentBoard]\n    : CurrentBoard[Row][Column] extends Connect4EmptyCell \n      ? ToInt<Row> \n      : CurrentBoard[Row][Column]\n};\n\ntype FindLastRowNotOccupied<\n  ColumStatus extends (number | Connect4Cell)[],\n  LastFreeCell extends number = never\n> =\n        ColumStatus extends [\n          infer CurrentCellStatus extends number, \n          ...infer OtherCellsStatuses extends (number | Connect4Chips)[]\n        ]\n          ? FindLastRowNotOccupied<OtherCellsStatuses, CurrentCellStatus>\n          : LastFreeCell;\n\ntype FindRowPosition<\n  CurrentBoard extends Connect4Board, \n  Column extends number\n> = FindLastRowNotOccupied<RowStatusFor<Column, CurrentBoard>>;\n\ntype PositionOnBoard<\n  CurrentBoard extends Connect4Board, \n  Column extends number\n> = [FindRowPosition<CurrentBoard, Column>, Column]\n```\n\nNow that I was able to calculate the position of the board for the current move, I was ready to create `UpdateBoard` \ntype. \nIn this type I passed the current position on the board to be updated, `NextMovePosition`, and looped over the board,\n to find the correspondent cell and update it. \nI created also a support type called `UpdateColumn` in order to separate the loop through the row and the column \npositions.\n\n```typescript\ntype UpdateColumn<\n  Row extends Connect4Cell[],\n  NextChip extends Connect4Chips, ColumnPosition extends number\n> = [...{\n  [Index in keyof Row]:\n    Index extends `${ColumnPosition}`\n          ? Row[Index] extends Connect4Cell\n                  ? NextChip\n                  : Row[Index]\n          : Row[Index]\n}];\n\ntype UpdateBoard<\n  CurrentBoard extends Connect4Board, \n  NextMovePosition extends [number, number], \n  NextChip extends Connect4Chips\n> =\n        NextMovePosition extends[number, number]\n                ? [...{\n                  [Index in keyof CurrentBoard]:\n                  Index extends `${NextMovePosition[0]}`\n                          ? UpdateColumn<CurrentBoard[Index], NextChip, NextMovePosition[1]>\n                          : CurrentBoard[Index]\n                }]\n                : CurrentBoard;\n```\n\nThe only part missing at this point was the update of the state. This was quite challenging. Especially the part \nwhere I needed to verify that someone won the game.\nIf you remember from the [previous challenge, tic tac toe](/2024/01/04/advent-of-typescript-2023-tic-tac-toe/), what \nI did was to hardcode the diagonal checks.\nHere I used the same approach.\nThe pain point was that the diagonals to be hardcoded are quite a few, especially considering the size of the board (6\nx 7), and the fact that the diagonal can be in two directions: from left to right and from right to left :sweat_smile:.\nBelow, you can find a schema I created from highlighting visually the diagonals from left to right.\n\n![The diagonals from left to right](../images/posts/advent-of-typescript-connect-4-diagonals.jpg \"The diagonals from left to right.\")\n\nThe base type I created is the `SequentialElementsWinningFor`.\nIt receives an array of board cells, it scans them to see if there is a sequence of four cells with the same chip, \nmeaning that one of the two players won.\nIf this condition is not found, `never` is returned (do you remember the discussion about it from one of my  \n[previous articles](/2023/12/30/advent-of-typescript-2023-rock-paper-scissors/)?)\nSo I composed multiple calls to `SequentialElementsWinningFor` with different lists of cells (including the diagonal \nand the columns with the wrapper type `ColumnWinningFor`) in a new type called `IsWinning`, that can be invoked two \ntimes (one time for each chip).\nThis is what I did in the `IsSomeoneWinning` type: a union type that describes the states of the two chips with \nrespect to the fact that one of them won the game.\nIn the end this is not a real union type, because the chips (both or just one) that are not in a winning state will \nreturn `never`, and so the union type will discard them.\n\n```typescript\ntype NextChip<CurrentState extends Connect4Chips> =\n        CurrentState extends '🔴'\n                ?

In this post we will continue to talk about lights in Blender.  \nWe will start by exploring how it is possible to add a light background and setup ambient light. We can setup these\noptions in the world property panel. Inside it we have a section \"world\" in which we can modify the background of our\nscene. We have some option to customize the final background result:\n\n* blend sky, if enabled blends the horizon and zenith sky\n* paper sky, if enabled with blend sky it maps the background colors to a plane\n* real sky, if enabled place the horizon color in the middle (as real sky)\n\nIn the same section there's also an ambient color property. The ambient color let us manage the overall light color.\n\n![Add a background ambient color](../images/posts/blender-background-ambient-color.jpg)\n\nWe can also choose to add a background image. To do that we have to go from the world tab directly to the texture tab.\nBlender will detect this operation and it will know that we are adding a texture to the background of our scene. From\nhere we can choose the type of texture we want and we can apply it.\n\n![Add a background texture](../images/posts/blender-background-texture.jpg)\n\nWe also have a specific type of light to simulate the sun: the sun lamp. It behaves in a similar way to the Hemi lamp.\nOne particular feature it has is the possibility to add a sky as background and simulate a sun in terms of shape and\neffects.  \nLast but not least we have ambient occlusion. It is a technique that let us simulate more accurately the ambient light\nin a scene. We can activate it from the world tab in the properties panel. It is possible to adjust how much ambient\nocclusion will influence the final rendering result by adjusting the factor property. Generally speaking, ambient\nocclusion is really slow in terms of rendering. Is it possible to improve the rendering speed by changing the gather\noptions in the world panel to \"approximate\" and setup the number of passes that the renderer must use. Ambient occlusion\nuses the ambient color by default. If we want to achieve a more accurate result, especially if our scene is an outdoor\none, we can activate the environment light. This kind of effect will generate ambient occlusion and eventually it will\nuse (if we choose it) the sky/sky texture as color.\n\n![Add ambient occlusion environment lighting](../images/posts/blender-ambient-occlusion-enviroment-lighting.jpg)\n\nIn the next post about Blender we will talk about cameras and rendering.\n","slug":"/2019/03/25/blender-tutorial-11-light-part-2/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about about how to do other cool stuff with lights in Blender.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"4d9cc8fb-e5c6-5f75-84f3-adc9a3555830":{"title":"The birth of ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger and my journey into the ID3 tag standard","content":"\n*The first of a short series of post in which I describe my two latest project: ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger. In this\npost I will talk about why I started to develop them.*\n\n---\n\nRecently I bought a new car. After a lot of searches I finally decided to buy the Renault Clio 2017 1.5 dci. I love this\ncar. It has been a big step forward on my previous car. One of its most interesting feature is its media entertainment\nsystem:\nthe [Media Nav Evolution system](https://www.renault.co.uk/renault-easy-connect/media-nav-evolution.html#fonctionnalites \"Media Nav Evolution\")\n. This system has a 7'' touchscreen with map integration and a basic smartphone integration with Siri voice recognition\nand phone call support.\n\n![The media nav system contained in a Renault Clio](../images/posts/media-nav-clio.jpg)\n\nOne of the thing that caught my attention was the possibility to start to listen to my mp3 collection while I'm\ndriving (on my previous car I had a standard cd player). So I prepared an usb key with some of my mp3 and I started to\nlisten to them. I suddenly made a great discovery: some of my songs were displayed on the touchscreen with information\nabout the album and they were displaying the cover of the album!!!!! :heart_eyes:. I though: \"Whoah this is very cool!!\nI need to start to fill my mp3 with all this information. I want to see the cover of the album for each mp3 I\nhave!!!!!!!\". This is exactly the moment where my journey into the development of ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger started,\nbut I was not yet aware of it :grin:. So I sat in front of my MacBook, I opened iTunes and I started to tag my mp3\nfiles. I saved them on a usb key and I went to my car to test them. The result was the following:\n\n![An mp3 tagged with iTunes](../images/posts/mp3-song-no-cover.jpg)\n\nWhat the hell is going on??!!?! :angry: The title and the album where displayed but the cover was not show on the\nscreen. So I got back to my desk and I started to download some native macOS app that let the user edit what I\ndiscovered was called *ID3 tag*. None of them worked as expected. Then I found an app called Mp3Tag. This is Windows\napplication that runs also on macOS using Wine. So I downloaded it and tried to tag some mp3. I put them on a usb key\nand then...\n\n![An mp3 tagged with Mp3Tag](../images/posts/mp3-song-with-cover.jpg)\n\nMp3Tag was working as expected :relieved:. But then I started to ask myself: \"What is doing Mp3Tag that the other native\nmacOS application are not doing?\". The only way to discover the reason behind this mystery was to compare an mp3 tagged\nwith Mp3Tag with an mp3 tagged with one of the other applications. So I opened with my favourite hex\neditor [HexFiend](https://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/ \"an hex editor\") an mp3 tagged with iTunes and another one tagged\nwith Mp3Tag and I compared them...\n\n![A comparison between an mp3 file tagged with iTunes and another one tagged with Mp3tag](../images/posts/mp3-tag-bit-cover.jpg)\n\nYep, a single byte could make a big difference :open_mouth:. The fact is that\nthe [ID3 standard](http://id3.org/d3v2.3.0 \"ID3 standard\") accept multiple types of attached picture for an mp3: front\ncover, back cover, icon, artist photo etc. The type of picture is represented as a byte just after the MIME type in the\nattached picture frame of the ID3 standard. The problem is that iTunes and other \"mp3 tagger\" native macOS applications\ndon't let the user modify the type of the attached picture. All this application set the byte to `0x00` that in the ID3\nstandard corresponds to the *\"Other\"* cover type. But the Media Nav Evolution system of my Renault Clio is able to read\nonly attached picture frames inserted in the tag with a specific type, for example `0x03` *\"Cover (Front)\"*, that is the\ndefault type inserted by Mp3Tag. The attached picture frames that have the `0x00` *\"Other\"* type are discarded :\nunamused:. My next question was: \"How is it possible that there's not a **native macOS** app? There are only cross\nplatform/web solution. I want an app that a real Apple fag would be happy to use...\":apple::stuck_out_tongue:. Honestly,\nI didn't find it. So I started to think: \"I could develop this app, using some modern framework/programming paradigm I\nstudied in the last months...In this way I have a chance to create my first macOS app and add some other interesting\nprojects to my [Github profile](https://github.com/chicio/ \"chicio github\"). Here we are after two months of work with\nthe public release of:\n\n* `ID3TagEditor`, a pure Swift framework (only Apple `Foundation` framework dependencies) to read/modify ID3 tag of your\n  mp3 files with support for the entire Apple ecosystem (macOS, iOS, watchOS) and Linux :heart_eyes:\n* `Mp3ID3Tagger`, a native macOS app written in Swift using the reactive programming paradigm and in particular its Rx (\n  Reactive Extensions) variant with the frameworks RxSwift and RxCocoa (Rx????!?!?!? WHAT?!?!?!? :cold_sweat:).\n\nIf you are still interested in knowing the details about the development of this two projects, you can follow the links\nbelow:\n\n* [ID3TagEditor: a Swift framework to read and write ID3 tag of your mp3 files for macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS](/2018/05/08/id3tageditor-swift-read-write-id3-tag-mp3/ \"id3 tag swift\")\n* [Mp3ID3Tagger: a native macOS app to edit the ID3 tag of your mp3 files written using RxSwift and RxCocoa](/2018/05/09/mp3id3tagger-macos-tag-mp3-id3-rxswift-rxcocoa/ \"mp3 tag macos rxswift rxcocoa\")\n\n![The Mp3ID3Tagger and ID3TagEditor icons](../images/posts/mp3id3tagger-id3tageditor.jpg)\n\nI hope you will see how much love and passion I put into this projects and I also hope you will find all the technical\ndetails inside them interesting :sparkling_heart:.\n","slug":"/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/","description":"The first of a short series of post in which I describe my two latest project: ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger.

In this post we will continue to learn how to use textures in Blender.  \nWe will start with normal maps. This kind of texture let us simulate rough surfaces without adding geometric details to\nthe mesh. We can set bump mapping in the texture tab under the Influence section. By checking the Geometry -> Normal\ncheckbox we let the texture be used as a reference to modify the normals of the mesh so that we can simulate additional\ngeometry details. It is possible to modify the quality of the map by adjusting the option in the same panel.\n\n![Normal mapping](../images/posts/blender-normal-mapping.jpg)\n\nAnother interesting texture technique useful to add details to our models is the displacement mapping. Instead of\ncreating the illusion of additional details, the displacement mapping modifies the geometry of an object. We can\nactivate the displacement mapping under the influence section of the texture tab. To obtain better result with the\ndisplacement mapping, it is useful to apply a subdivision surface modifier to the object.\n\n![Displacement mapping](../images/posts/blender-displacement-mapping.jpg)\n\nOne final tool we have for textures is the node editor. With it we can join multiple textures into a single one to\nobtain a more complex texture. We can activate it in a new window by selecting the \"Node Editor\" visualization. After we\nactivate the \"Use nodes\" option we compose complex texture by adding more node (with the menu at the bottom of the view)\nand we can compose them to obtain our final texture.\n\n![The node editor](../images/posts/blender-node-editor.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will talk about light.\n","slug":"/2019/03/23/blender-tutorial-9-textures-part-2/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk other about textures techniques.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"50d49258-d894-5667-bafe-f3460a52ef6c":{"title":"React Native: the power of RCTBundleURLProvider to build, run and debug on an iOS device from Xcode","content":"\n*Do you know how to debug your react native app on a iOS device?*\n\n---\n\nIn the last few days I was working in pair programming with my\ncolleague [Mariano Patafio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariano-patafio-4a8b7426/ \"Mariano Patafio\") on some new\nfeatures for a React Native app. [Mariano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariano-patafio-4a8b7426/ \"Mariano Patafio\") is a\nsenior iOS and Android developer and a true \":apple: Apple fag :apple:\" :laughing: (like me :\nstuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). At some point during our pair session we wanted to test the app on a real iOS device.\nThe app we were working on was an existing iOS app in which we added some React Native views. If you follow the\ninstructions contained in the React Native doc about integrating it in an existing app, you will discover that with that\nsetup you will not be able to run your app on a real device from Xcode. It will work just in the simulator.  \nIn this post I will show you what we discovered: it is possible with the right setup to build, run and debug your React\nNative app from Xcode. To do this I will use the React Native example app I used in\nthis [previous post I wrote about how to create multiple RCTRootView inside you existing app integrated with React Native](/2017/12/08/react-native-multiple-instance-rctrootview/ \"react native multiple rctrootview\")\n. The app is very simple: it contains a main screen with 2 buttons that let the user open two different React Native\nviews. You can find this example with the implementation described below\nin [this github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Multiple-RCTRootView \"React native multiple RCTRootView\")\n.  \nLet's assume we start with the old implementation of the app described above, where we implemented a  \n`ReactNativeBridgeDelegate` that returns the url of the index.bundle that contains our React Native code JS compiled.\nThis url was pointing to a localhost environment.\n\n```swift\nclass ReactNativeBridge {\n    let bridge: RCTBridge\n\n    init() {\n        bridge = RCTBridge(delegate: ReactNativeBridgeDelegate(), launchOptions: nil)\n    }\n}\n\nclass ReactNativeBridgeDelegate: NSObject, RCTBridgeDelegate {\n\n    func sourceURL(for bridge: RCTBridge!) -> URL! {\n        return URL(string: \"http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n![The react native bridge delegate still uses the localhost url to load the bundled JS](../images/posts/react-native-bridge-delegate-localhost.jpg)\n\nIf we try to build this app on an iPhone, and we open one of the React Native screen we will receive the following\nerror (obviously based on the fact that we are trying to access localhost from the iPhone, and our React Native node\nserver is running on the MacBook Pro where we are building the app).\n\n![If you run the app with the localhost url above, you will receive an error](../images/posts/react-native-error-on-device-failed-bundle.jpg)\n\nHow can we build on a real device? First of all we need to add a new build phase to our project that let us run\nthe `React Native Xcode Bundler` before the real build. The `React Native Xcode Bundler` is a shell script with\nname `react-native-xcode.sh` that you can find inside your react native npm package\nunder `<you app root folder.>/node_modules/react-native/scripts/`. This script must take as input our React Native\nindex.js.\n\n![Add the release bundler script as an Xcode phase](../images/posts/react-native-setup-bundler.jpg)\n\nNow we can change our `ReactNativeBridgeDelegate` implementation. Instead of returning an hard coded url, we use\nthe `RCTBundleURLProvider.sharedSettings().jsBundleURL(forBundleRoot: \"index\", fallbackResource: nil)` method. We need\nto pass `\"index\"` as bundle root parameter (the name of the main js file).\n\n![The ReactNativeBridgeDelegate gets the JS url from RCTBundleURLProvider](../images/posts/react-native-bundle-url-provider-setup.jpg)\n\nNow we can try to build an run again the app on a real device. As you can see now everything works as expected.\n\n![Now the app works correctly on a real device](../images/posts/react-native-app-working-on-device.jpg)\n\nWhat's happening under the hood? Which kind of \"magic\" are we using here :smirk:? If we start to debug from the call\nto `RCTBundleURLProvider.sharedSettings().jsBundleURL(forBundleRoot: \"index\", fallbackResource: nil)` and we go inside\nthe React Native source code at some point we will see a call to a method named `guessPackagerHost`. In this method\nthere's a piece of code that tries to open and read the content of a file named `ip.txt` (this file is supposed to be in\nthe main bundle of the app). The string returned by this method is used as hostname in the url used by React Native to\ncall the packager we are running on our mac.  \nWho did create this `ip.txt` file? Previously we added the execution of the `React Native Bundler` script as build\nphase. If we look at the source code of this script you will find the following piece of code:\n\n![The react-native-xcode.sh script source code](../images/posts/react-native-ip-txt-generation.jpg)\n\nWhat?!?!?!?!?!? :satisfied: This piece of code basically creates a file named `ip.txt` that contains the IP address of\nyour computer, extracted using an `ifconfig` command, concatenated with the domain `xip.io`. So the file will contain a\nstring like the following one: `<your computer IP address>.xip.io`. This is the string returned by\nthe `guessPackagerHost` method. In the screenshot below you can find the source code of this method and the string that\nit returns.\n\n![The react native source that reads the ip from the ip.txt file](../images/posts/react-native-my-local-ip.jpg)\n\nWhat is the `xip.io` string added after the IP address? [xip.io](http://xip.io/ \"xip.io\") is a public free DNS server\ncreated at [basecamp](https://basecamp.com \"basecamp\"). Below you can find a quote from the homepage of the service:\n\n> What is xip.io?\n> xip.io is a magic domain name that provides wildcard DNS\n> for any IP address. Say your LAN IP address is 10.0.0.1.\n> Using xip.io,\n>\n>10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1\n> www.10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1\n> mysite.10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1\n> foo.bar.10.0.0.1.xip.io   resolves to   10.0.0.1\n>\n>...and so on. You can use these domains to access virtual\n> hosts on your development web server from devices on your\n> local network, like iPads, iPhones, and other computers.\n> No configuration required!\n>\n>How does it work? xip.io runs a custom DNS server on the public Internet. When your computer looks up a xip.io domain, the xip.io DNS server extracts the IP address from the domain and sends it back in the response.\n\n![xip.io service](../images/posts/react-native-xipio.jpg)\n\nThis basically means that xip.io is a domain name we can use to access our local packager environment on our mac from\nour iPhone and iPad, based on the fact that the devices are all on the same network. That's all, and as you can see\neverything works \"like magic\" :relaxed:.  \n","slug":"/2018/02/08/react-native-debug-on-device-rctbundleurlprovider/","description":"Do you know how to debug your react native app on a iOS device?","authors":["fabrizio-duroni","mariano-patafio"]},"52e91f44-2451-53f4-b2ff-4b981095332d":{"title":"Advent of TypeScript 2023: Tic tac toe (Day 21)","content":"\n*Tic tac toe, another classical kata game you can find at a coding dojo.

Because the input of the `TicTacToe` type I had to implement receive \nin input two parameters:\n* the current game, `TicTacToeGame`, composed by a `board` and a `state`, that described the next move or the end of \n  the game (who won or draw)\n* the next move to be applied (based on the `state` that describe also the next chip to be calculated)\nLet's take a look also at the test cases provided by TypeHero to check if the implementation is correct, that show \n  the configuration I just described.\n\n```typescript\ntype test_move1_actual = TicTacToe<NewGame, 'top-center'>;\n\ntype test_move2_actual = TicTacToe<test_move1_actual, 'top-left'>;\n/*\ntype test_move2_expected = {\n  board: [\n    ['⭕', '❌', '  '], \n    ['  ', '  ', '  '], \n    ['  ', '  ', '  ']];\n  state: '❌';\n}\n*/\n\ntype test_move3_actual = TicTacToe<test_move2_actual, 'middle-center'>;\n/*\ntype test_move3_expected = {\n  board: [\n    [ '⭕', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '  ', '  ' ]\n  ];\n  state: '⭕';\n};\n*/\n\ntype test_move4_actual = TicTacToe<test_move3_actual, 'bottom-left'>;\n/*\ntype test_move4_expected = {\n  board: [\n    [ '⭕', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '⭕', '  ', '  ' ]\n  ];\n  state: '❌';\n};\n*/\n\ntype test_x_win_actual = TicTacToe<test_move4_actual, 'bottom-center'>;\n/*\ntype test_x_win_expected = {\n  board: [\n    [ '⭕', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '⭕', '❌', '  ' ]\n  ];\n  state: '❌ Won';\n};\n*/\n\ntype type_move5_actual = TicTacToe<test_move4_actual, 'bottom-right'>;\n/*\ntype type_move5_expected = {\n  board: [\n    [ '⭕', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '⭕', '  ', '❌' ]\n  ];\n  state: '⭕';\n};\n*/\n\ntype test_invalid_actual = TicTacToe<test_move1_actual, 'top-center'>;\n/*\ntype test_invalid_expected = {\n  board: [\n    [ '  ', '❌', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '  ', '  ' ],\n    [ '  ', '  ', '  ' ]\n  ];\n  state: '⭕';\n};\n*/\n\ntype test_before_draw = {\n  board: [\n    ['⭕', '❌', '⭕'],\n    ['⭕', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '⭕', '  ']];\n  state: '⭕';\n}\ntype test_draw_actual = TicTacToe<test_before_draw, 'bottom-right'>;\n/*\ntype test_draw_expected = {\n  board: [\n    ['⭕', '❌', '⭕'], \n    ['⭕', '❌', '❌'], \n    ['❌', '⭕', '⭕']];\n  state: 'Draw';\n}\n*/\n```\n\nThe first thing I needed to complete the challege was a type to translate the next position, received as a string \ncombination of `TicTacToeXPositions` and `TicTacToeYPositions`, in a position on the 3x3 board.\nRemember I can use only types, so in this case I needed to implement a string equal check to extract the \ncorresponding position on the board for a specific X and Y position (described as words).  \nWell, as I showed already in the [previous article](/2023/12/30/advent-of-typescript-2023-rock-paper-scissors/), I \nleveraged also in this case the power of conditional type.\nIn this specific case I used also the `infer` keyword, that allowed me to access the parts of the move string and \ntranslate them using two support maps, `XFrom` and `YFrom`.  \nAs you can see from the code below, the TypeScript type system is so powerful that it is basically able to split a \nstring that matches a specific pattern and gave me access to these parts.\nIn case the move is invalid (e.g., a `top-center` move), I return undefined: this let me check if the move is valid \nbefore doing everything else.\n\n```typescript\n\ntype XFrom<TicTacToeXPosition extends TicTacToeXPositions> = {\n    'left': 0,\n    'center': 1,\n    'right': 2\n}[TicTacToeXPosition];\n\ntype YFrom<TicTacToeXPosition extends TicTacToeYPositions> = {\n    'top': 0,\n    'middle': 1,\n    'bottom': 2\n}[TicTacToeXPosition];\n\ntype PositionOnBoardFrom<Move extends TicTacToePositions> = \n    Move extends `${infer TicTacToeYPosition extends TicTacToeYPositions}-${infer TicTacToeXPosition extends TicTacToeXPositions}` \n        ? [YFrom<TicTacToeYPosition>, XFrom<TicTacToeXPosition>]\n        : undefined;\n```\n\nAs I mentioned just a few lines above, I needed to check if the new move is valid. For this goal I created a \n`IsValidMove` type: it will return `true` if the next position exists on the board, and it is not occupied by \nanother chip.\nIn all the other cases, it will return false.\n\n```typescript\ntype IsValidMove<CurrentTicTacToeGame extends TicTacToeGame, NextMovePosition extends [number, number] | undefined> =\n  NextMovePosition extends [number, number]\n    ? CurrentTicTacToeGame['board'][NextMovePosition[0]][NextMovePosition[1]] extends TicTacToeChip\n      ? false\n      : true\n    : false\n```\n\nAt this point, I was ready to define the types needed to update the board (in case the move is valid).\nTo do this, I created a `UpdateBoard` type.\nIt uses [mapped types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html) to loop through the board \nand add the chip only to the cell that should be updated.\nTo do this, I created a support `UpdateColumn`.\nIn this way:\n* in `UpdateBoard` I loop through the rows until I found the one that correspond to the row contained in \n  `NextMovePosition[0]` \n* in `UpdateColumn` I update the cell corresponding to the column contained in `NextMovePosition[1]`\n\n```typescript\ntype UpdateColumn<Row extends TicTacToeCell[], NextChip extends TicTacToeChip, ColumnPosition extends number> = [...{\n  [Index in keyof Row]:\n  Index extends `${ColumnPosition}`\n    ? Row[Index] extends TicTacToeEmptyCell\n      ? NextChip\n      : Row[Index]\n    : Row[Index]\n}];\n\ntype UpdateBoard<CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard, NextMovePosition extends [number, number], NextChip extends TicTacToeChip> =\n  NextMovePosition extends [number, number]\n    ? [...{\n      [Index in keyof CurrentBoard]:\n      Index extends `${NextMovePosition[0]}`\n        ? UpdateColumn<CurrentBoard[Index], NextChip, NextMovePosition[1]>\n        : CurrentBoard[Index]\n    }]\n    : CurrentBoard;\n```\n\nThe \"last piece of the puzzle\" needed to have a fully functioning tic tac toe implementation is a type that update \nthe state of the game.\nIt should be able to:\n* determine if the game is in a final state, given the updated board. That means check if one of the players won.\n* if not, determine if we are in a draw state or not and if needed, update the chip to the next one.\nFor the first part I created a `IsSomeoneWinning` type.\n  Its responsibility is to check for each of the chips if it won the game.\n  It does this by scanning rows, columns and diagonals to check if there is a sequence of three cells with the same \n  chip (the one we are checking for winning or not).\n  In all the cases for which there is no win, this type returns `never`.\n  So to check the result of this type, I just needed to check if it `extends never`, meaning that no player won.\n  In all the other cases, it will return a string described which chip won the game.  \n\n```typescript\ntype RowWinningFor<Chip extends TicTacToeChip, Row extends string[]> =  Row extends Chip[] ? `${Chip} Won` : never;\n\ntype ColumnWinningFor<Chip extends TicTacToeChip, ColumnIndex extends number, CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard> = {\n  [Index in keyof CurrentBoard]: CurrentBoard[Index][ColumnIndex]\n} extends Chip[] ? `${Chip} Won` : never;\n\ntype LeftDiagonalWinning<Chip extends TicTacToeChip, CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard> =\n  CurrentBoard[0][0] extends Chip\n    ?  CurrentBoard[1][1] extends Chip\n      ?  CurrentBoard[2][2] extends Chip\n        ? `${Chip} Won`\n        : never\n      : never\n    : never\n\ntype RightDiagonalWinning<Chip extends TicTacToeChip, CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard> =\n  CurrentBoard[2][0] extends Chip\n    ?  CurrentBoard[1][1] extends Chip\n      ?  CurrentBoard[0][2] extends Chip\n        ? `${Chip} Won`\n        : never\n      : never\n    : never\n\ntype IsWinning<Chip extends TicTacToeChip, CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard> =\n  RowWinningFor<Chip, CurrentBoard[0]> |\n  RowWinningFor<Chip, CurrentBoard[1]> |\n  RowWinningFor<Chip, CurrentBoard[2]> |\n  ColumnWinningFor<Chip, 0, CurrentBoard> |\n  ColumnWinningFor<Chip, 1, CurrentBoard> |\n  ColumnWinningFor<Chip, 2, CurrentBoard> |\n  LeftDiagonalWinning<Chip, CurrentBoard> |\n  RightDiagonalWinning<Chip, CurrentBoard>;\n\ntype IsSomeoneWinning<CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard> = IsWinning<'❌',CurrentBoard> | IsWinning<'⭕',CurrentBoard>;\n```\nIf none of the players won, I needed t check if there are still empty cells to continue the game. This is the reason \nwhy I created `AreThereEmptyCells`, that checks if the players still have any move available.   \n\n```typescript\ntype AreThereEmptyCellsOnRow<Row extends TicTacToeCell[]> =\n  Row extends [infer Current, ...infer Others extends TicTacToeCell[]]\n    ? Current extends TicTacToeEmptyCell\n      ? true\n      : AreThereEmptyCellsOnRow<Others>\n    : false\n\ntype AreThereEmptyCells<CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard> =\n  AreThereEmptyCellsOnRow<CurrentBoard[0]> &\n  AreThereEmptyCellsOnRow<CurrentBoard[1]> &\n  AreThereEmptyCellsOnRow<CurrentBoard[2]>;\n```\n\nSo now I was able to create the `UpdateState` type as a composition of the previous types. What it does is:\n* use `IsSomeoneWinning` to check if someone won. If it is so, its result is returned\n* if none of the player won, it uses `AreThereEmptyCells` to check if there are still available moves:\n** if there are, the next chip is returned from `NextChipFrom`\n** if no moves are available, the game is in draw state and `Draw` is returned. \n\n```typescript\ntype NextChipFrom<CurrentState extends TicTacToeChip> =\n  CurrentState extends '❌'\n    ? '⭕'\n    : '❌'\n\ntype UpdateState<CurrentBoard extends TicTactToeBoard, NextMovePosition extends [number, number], CurrentChip extends TicTacToeChip> =\n  IsSomeoneWinning<UpdateBoard<CurrentBoard, NextMovePosition, CurrentChip>> extends never\n    ? AreThereEmptyCells<UpdateBoard<CurrentBoard, NextMovePosition, CurrentChip>> extends true\n      ? NextChipFrom<CurrentChip>\n      : 'Draw'\n    : IsSomeoneWinning<UpdateBoard<CurrentBoard, NextMovePosition, CurrentChip>>;\n```\n\nAt this point the final `TicTacToe` game type can be created (again by composition of the previous types). It \nbasically creates a new game state, with an updated `board` and `state`, using the types above. \n\n```typescript\ntype TicTacToe<CurrentTicTacToeGame extends TicTacToeGame, NextMove extends TicTacToePositions> =\n  IsValidMove<CurrentTicTacToeGame, PositionOnBoardFrom<NextMove>> extends false\n    ? CurrentTicTacToeGame\n    : CurrentTicTacToeGame['state'] extends TicTacToeChip\n      ? {\n        board: UpdateBoard<CurrentTicTacToeGame['board'], PositionOnBoardFrom<NextMove>, CurrentTicTacToeGame['state']>\n        state: UpdateState<CurrentTicTacToeGame['board'], PositionOnBoardFrom<NextMove>, CurrentTicTacToeGame['state']>\n      }\n      : CurrentTicTacToeGame;\n```\n\nBelow, you can find the full solution and the test cases we saw before to verify its correctness.\n\n```typescript\n// domain \n\ntype TicTacToeChip = '❌' | '⭕';\ntype TicTacToeEndState = '❌ Won' | '⭕ Won' | 'Draw';\ntype TicTacToeState = TicTacToeChip | TicTacToeEndState;\ntype TicTacToeEmptyCell = '  '\ntype TicTacToeCell = TicTacToeChip | TicTacToeEmptyCell;\ntype TicTacToeYPositions = 'top' | 'middle' | 'bottom';\ntype TicTacToeXPositions = 'left' | 'center' | 'right';\ntype TicTacToePositions = `${TicTacToeYPositions}-${TicTacToeXPositions}`;\ntype TicTactToeBoard = TicTacToeCell[][];\ntype TicTacToeGame = {\n  board: TicTactToeBoard;\n  state: TicTacToeState;\n};\n\ntype EmptyBoard = [\n  ['  ', '  ', '  '],\n  ['  ', '  ', '  '],\n  ['  ', '  ', '  ']\n];\n\ntype NewGame = {\n  board: EmptyBoard;\n  state: '❌';\n};\n\n// Board\n\ntype XFrom<TicTacToeXPosition extends TicTacToeXPositions> = {\n  'left': 0,\n  'center': 1,\n  'right': 2\n}[TicTacToeXPosition];\n\ntype YFrom<TicTacToeXPosition extends TicTacToeYPositions> = {\n  'top': 0,\n  'middle': 1,\n  'bottom': 2\n}[TicTacToeXPosition];\n\ntype PositionOnBoardFrom<Move extends TicTacToePositions> =\n  Move extends `${infer TicTacToeYPosition extends TicTacToeYPositions}-${infer TicTacToeXPosition extends TicTacToeXPositions}`\n    ?

Let's see how you can use UIViewRepresentable and\nUIViewControllerRepresentable to use your UIKit based component or to fill the gap for missing SwiftUI API.*\n\n---\n\nSwiftUI has been around for more than a year now. With its reactive paradigm approach it is a big step forward when\ncompared to the UIKit imperative approach. But as a consequence of the fact that UIKit has been with\nus [for almost twelve years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK) and there are millions of apps already publish on\nthe app store, a lot of developers have tons of UKit based library and custom components. Another interesting point is\nthe fact that at the moment of this writing a lot of UIKit components from the iOS SDK\nare [missing a counterpart in SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/answering-the-big-question-should-you-learn-swiftui-uikit-or-both \"uikit missing swiftui\")\n.  \nAnyway, you are just starting to develop a new app and you want to create it in SwiftUI (targeting only for iOS 13 and\nup because, you know, for compatibility reason :laughing:) without losing the ability to speed up you development by\nreusing your UIKit based libraries and components. Is there a solution to this problem? Yes!! :relaxed:  \nIn this post I will show you how you can leverage the power of `UIViewRepresentable` and `UIViewControllerRepresentable`\nprotocols to expose your UIKit views and controller as standard SwiftUI components. Before going deeper with an example\nlet's see the definition of this two protocol from the official Apple documentation.  \nLet's start\nfrom [UIViewRepresentable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable \"uiviewrepresentable documentation\"):\n\n> UIViewRepresentable. A wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate that view into your SwiftUI view hierarchy...Adopt this protocol in one of your app's custom instances, and use its methods to create, update, and tear down your view. The creation and update processes parallel the behavior of SwiftUI views, and you use them to configure your view with your app's current state information...\n\nAnd here we have the other one\nfor [UIViewControllerRepresentable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewcontrollerrepresentable \"uiviewcontrollerrepresentable\"):\n\n> UIViewControllerRepresentable. A view that represents a UIKit view controller...Adopt this protocol in one of your app's custom instances, and use its methods to create, update, and tear down your view controller. The creation and update processes parallel the behavior of SwiftUI views, and you use them to configure your view controller with your app's current state information...The system doesn't automatically communicate changes occurring within your view controller to other parts of your SwiftUI interface. When you want your view controller to coordinate with other SwiftUI views, you must provide a Coordinator instance to facilitate those interactions. For example, you use a coordinator to forward target-action and delegate messages from your view controller to any SwiftUI views.\n\nThere are a lot of concepts here: view lifecycle, notification, delegation and communication with Coordinator. :\ncold_sweat: But don't worry, with an example you will see how easy it is to use `UIViewRepresentable`\nand `UIViewControllerRepresentable`.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nIn this example we will create a simple app that will let the user select a document using and instance of the UIKit\nbased controller `UIDocumentPickerViewController` and we will print the name of the file selected using a customized\nUIKit `UILabel`. Let's start from the custom UIKit `UILabel` view. To use our custom `UILabel` in SwiftUI we need to\nwrap it in a struct that implements the first protocol we saw above: `UIViewRepresentable`. This protocol contains two\nmethods:\n\n- `makeUIView(context: Self.Context) -> Self.UIViewType`, a method where you create the UIKit to be used in SwiftUI\n- `updateUIView(_ uiView: Self.UIViewType, context: Self.Context)` a method called when the view must be redrawn due to\n  external changes (e.g. a State update)\n\nThe `Self.UIViewType` type is\nan [associated type](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/74/understanding-protocol-associated-types-and-their-constraints \"swift protocol associated type\")\nof the protocol and it must match the type of the UIKit view wrapped.  \nSo for our example we can implement a `DocumentNameLabel` struct that implements the `UIViewRepresentable` protocol. In\nthe `makeUIView` method we create an instance of the customized UILabel that we want to expose. In the `updateUIView` we\nwill update the text shown by the label with the value contained in a `@Binding` var updated from the container view (do\nyou\nremember [what is a @Binding var](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/what-is-the-binding-property-wrapper \"binding swiftui\")\n, right?).\n\n```swift\nstruct DocumentNameLabel: UIViewRepresentable {\n    @Binding var content: String\n\n    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UILabel {\n        let label = UILabel()\n        label.backgroundColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.721568644, green: 0.8862745166, blue: 0.5921568871, alpha: 1)\n        label.layer.borderColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.2745098174, green: 0.4862745106, blue: 0.1411764771, alpha: 1)\n        label.layer.borderWidth = 2\n        return label\n    }\n\n    func updateUIView(_ uiView: UILabel, context: Context) {\n        uiView.text = content\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter the view, we need to take care of the UIKit controller used to select the\ndocument, `UIDocumentPickerViewController`. We will wrap it in a struct that implements\nthe `UIViewControllerRepresentable`. This protocol contains four methods:\n\n- `makeUIViewController(context: Self.Context) -> Self.UIViewControllerType`, a method used to create the instance of\n  the view controller to be used in your SwiftUI screen\n- `updateUIViewController(Self.UIViewControllerType, context: Self.Context)`, a method called when the view controller\n  must be redrawn/updated due to external changes (e.g. a State update)\n- `makeCoordinator() -> Self.Coordinator`, a method used to create the custom instance that you use to communicate\n  changes from your view controller to other parts of your SwiftUI interface\n- `static func dismantleUIViewController(Self.UIViewControllerType, coordinator: Self.Coordinator)`, a method called to\n  clean up additional resources used by the view controller when it is dismissed\n\nAs for the previous protocol, The `Self.UIViewControllerType` type is\nan [associated type](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/74/understanding-protocol-associated-types-and-their-constraints \"swift protocol associated type\")\nof the protocol and he must match the type of the UIViewController wrapped.  \nLe't start from the first method reported above, where we will create the instance of\nthe `UIDocumentPickerViewController` that we want to expose to SwiftUI. The delegate of this controller will be\nthe `Coordinator` instance created in the `makeCoodinator` protocol method. So the Coordinator will be responder for all\nthe `UIDocumentPickerDelegate` methods. Remember that the `makeCoordinator` method is called before everything else when\nwe will create our `DocumentPickerViewController` instance in SwiftUI. The `Coordinator` receive a reference to the\nwrapping struct. This reference is used to trigger a custom callback contained in the `var callback: (URL) -> ()`\nproperty that is received at `DocumentPickerViewController` construction time when\nthe `documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL])` method of\nthe `UIDocumentPickerDelegate` protocol is invoked. In this way we are able to send back to SwiftUI the result of the\ninteraction with the `UIDocumentPickerViewController`. Last but not least there's also the `updateUIViewController`\nmethod, but in this case with an empty implementation because we don't need to update the status of the view controller\nusing some SwiftUI state change.\n\n```swift\nstruct DocumentPickerViewController: UIViewControllerRepresentable {\n    var callback: (URL) -> ()\n\n    func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {\n        return Coordinator(documentController: self)\n    }\n\n    func updateUIViewController(\n        _ uiViewController: UIDocumentPickerViewController,\n        context: UIViewControllerRepresentableContext<DocumentPickerViewController>) {\n    }\n\n    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> UIDocumentPickerViewController {\n        let controller = UIDocumentPickerViewController(documentTypes: [String(kUTTypeText)], in: .open)\n        controller.delegate = context.coordinator\n        return controller\n    }\n\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, UIDocumentPickerDelegate {\n        var documentController: DocumentPickerViewController\n\n        init(documentController: DocumentPickerViewController) {\n            self.documentController = documentController\n        }\n\n        func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL]) {\n            guard let url = urls.first, url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() else { return }\n            defer { url.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource() }\n            documentController.callback(urls[0])\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we are ready to use our UIKit controller and our custom UIView in a SwiftUI view. We can just add them to the `body`\nfield of our view and use them as a standard SwiftUI component. One thing to be noted is the set of the `frame` on\nthe `DocumentNameLabel` component. This is a consequence of the fact that sometimes the UIKit views wrapped with\nthe `UIViewRepresentable` protocol take as much space as they can in a `VStack` component. This means that if we don't\nset the frame in our example the label would take the majority of the screen space (leaving only the space for button to\nbe shown).\n\n```swift\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State var isDocumentPickerPresented: Bool = false\n    @State var documentUrl: String = \"\"\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack{\n            Spacer()\n            DocumentNameLabel(content: self.$documentUrl)\n                .frame(height: 40)\n            Button(action: {\n                self.isDocumentPickerPresented.toggle()\n            }, label: { Text(\"Document selection\") })\n                .frame(height: 40, alignment: .center)\n                .sheet(isPresented: self.$isDocumentPickerPresented, content: {\n                    DocumentPickerViewController { url in\n                        self.documentUrl = url.lastPathComponent\n                    }\n                })\n            Spacer()\n        }\n        .padding(10)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find all the code above in\nthis [example repository on Github](https://github.com/chicio/Use-UIKit-In-SwiftUI \"github swiftui uikit\"). Don't\nhesitate to clone it and start to play with the example. `UIViewRepresentable` and `UIViewControllerRepresentable` are\nthe tools provided by Apple to let you mix the power and versatility of UIKit with the declarative reactive approach of\nSwiftUI. I hope that in next future releases of the iOS SDK there will be no need to write this custom wrapper\ncomponents at least for all the standard UIKit components.\n","slug":"/2020/07/02/expose-uikit-to-swiftui/","description":"Do you know that it is possible to use UKit components in SwiftUI?

In this post I will show you\nhow to create it by leveraging the Metatype Type, Generics, the Hashable protocol and the Equatable protocol.*\n\n---\n\nThe open source Swift world is full of useful framework. You can find almost everything you need (there\nare [rare cases where you need to write something that still doesn't exist](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/ \"id3 tag editor\")\nout there). Anyway, a lot of the frameworks and libraries you will find out do more than you need. See for example the\nworld of the dependencies injection framework. We have a lot of alternatives from which we can\nchoose: [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject \"dependencies injection swift Swinject\")\n, [Weaver](https://github.com/scribd/Weaver \"dependecies injection swift Weaver\") etc. This frameworks come with a lot\nof features like: object graph construction, injection with property wrappers, instance persistence etc. This are all\nuseful feature, but if your needs are very limited (just a dependecies container register/resolver using protocol and\nclasses) the previous frameworks gives you just a big overhead and complexity on you code. This is why for my recent\nproject I tried to write my own very simple dependencies injector container by leveraging the power of Swift Metatype\nand the Hashable protocol. Let's go and see the how I created it :smirk:.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe main class of dependencies injector container is composed by 2 classes: `DependeciesContainer` and `DependencyKey`\n.  \nThe main one stores in the field `dependecies` a dictionary of all the dependencies registered using an instance of the\nsecond one. `DependeciesContainer` exposes two methods:\n\n* `register<T>(type: T.Type, name: String? = nil, service: Any)`, that lets you register a new dependency in the\n  container. It accepts 3 parameter. The first one is the `Type` of the dependency. The second one is a string that\n  let's you identify different named variations of the same dependencies (e.g. you register `Cat` and `Dog`, two\n  different implementation of an hypothetical `Animal` protocol). The third one is the instance saved in\n  the `dependecies` dictionary.\n\n* `resolve<T>(type: T.Type, name: String? = nil) -> T?`, that lets you get an instance previously registered. This\n  method accept the same first two parameter of the previous method. It will return null if none of the registered\n  instance has a combination of `type` and `name` as the one received as parameters.\n\nAs you can see both method extensively uses generics in order to be able to accept any possible class or protocol you\nmay want to use. This is the implementation of `DependeciesContainer`.\n\n```swift\nclass DependeciesContainer {\n    static let shared = DependeciesContainer()\n\n    private init() {}\n\n    private var dependecies: [DependencyKey : Any] = [:]\n\n    func register<T>(type: T.Type, name: String? = nil, service: Any) {\n        let dependencyKey = DependencyKey(type: type, name: name)\n        dependecies[dependencyKey] = service\n    }\n\n    func resolve<T>(type: T.Type, name: String? = nil) -> T? {\n        let dependencyKey = DependencyKey(type: type, name: name)\n        return dependecies[dependencyKey] as? T\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, you can ask some question after seeing this code. First of all, what is a `Type`?\nApple [defines it](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Types.html#grammar_metatype-type \"swift metatype\")\nas:\n\n> A metatype type refers to the type of any type, including class types, structure types, enumeration types, and protocol types.\n\nA metatype is the representation of the type of an instance. It allows you to use all of class properties and methods of\na type. It allows also to threat your code as a data. In this specific case we are using the `Type` metatype to identify\nan instance from its own description.  \nThe second one question that you could ask is: how can you use the `DependecyKey` class instances as key in\nyour `dependecies` dictionary? This is possible thanks to the `Hashable` and `Equatable` protocols. This class\nimplements the `hash(into hasher: inout Hasher)` method of the `Hashable` protocol by using the combination of `type`\nand `name` received from the `DependeciesContainer`. In that method I'm putting in the same hasher the `type` and\nthe `name`. In particular for the first one I'm extracting a unique identifier using the `ObjectIdentifier` function\nfrom the Swift `Reflection` package.  \nIt also implements the `Equatable` protocol using the same fields in\nthe `static func == (lhs: DependencyKey, rhs: DependencyKey) -> Bool` method. By implementing this two protocol a class\ncould be used as key in a dictionary.\n\n```swift\nclass DependencyKey: Hashable, Equatable {\n    private let type: Any.Type\n    private let name: String?\n\n    init(type: Any.Type, name: String? = nil) {\n        self.type = type\n        self.name = name\n    }\n\n    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {\n        hasher.combine(ObjectIdentifier(type))\n        hasher.combine(name)\n    }\n\n    static func == (lhs: DependencyKey, rhs: DependencyKey) -> Bool {\n        return lhs.type == rhs.type && lhs.name == rhs.name\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is all I need for my ultra light dependencies injector :heart_eyes:!!! Let's see it in action in an example.\n\n```swift\nprotocol Animal {\n    func isAlive() -> Bool\n}\n\nclass Cat: Animal {\n    func isAlive() -> Bool {\n        true\n    }\n\n    func miaow() -> String {\n        return \"miaow\"\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog: Animal {\n    func isAlive() -> Bool {\n        true\n    }\n\n    func bark() -> String {\n        return \"wooof\"\n    }\n}\n\nclass Tiger: Animal {\n    func isAlive() -> Bool {\n        true\n    }\n\n    func roar() -> String {\n        return \"roar\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nprotocol Person {\n    func breath() -> String\n}\n\nclass SickPerson: Person {\n    func breath() -> String {\n        return \"fiuu\"\n    }\n\n    func cough() -> String {\n        return \"cough\"\n    }\n}\n\nlet dc = DependeciesContainer.shared\n\n// Register using class `Type` Dog\ndc.register(type: Dog.self, service: Dog())\nlet dog = dc.resolve(type: Dog.self)!\nprint(String(describing: dog)) // \"__lldb_expr_7.Dog\\n\"\nprint(dog.bark()) // \"wooof\\n\"\n\n// Register using protocol `Type` Person\ndc.register(type: Person.self, service: SickPerson())\nlet person = dc.resolve(type: Person.self)!\nprint(String(describing: person)) // \"__lldb_expr_7.SickPerson\\n\"\nprint(person.breath()) // \"fiuu\\n\"\nprint((person as! SickPerson).cough()) // \"cough\\n\"\n\n// Register using protocol `Type` Animal and variations\ndc.register(type: Animal.self, name: \"Cat\", service: Cat())\ndc.register(type: Animal.self, name: \"Tiger\", service: Tiger())\nlet cat = dc.resolve(type: Animal.self, name: \"Cat\")!\nprint(String(describing: cat)) // \"__lldb_expr_9.Cat\\n\"\nprint(cat.isAlive())\nprint((cat as! Cat).miaow()) //\"miaow\\n\"\nlet tiger = dc.resolve(type: Animal.self, name: \"Tiger\")!\nprint(String(describing: tiger)) // \"__lldb_expr_9.Tiger\\n\"\nprint(tiger.isAlive())\nprint((tiger as! Tiger).roar()) // \"roar\\n\"\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find all the code shown in this\npost [in this Github repo](https://github.com/chicio/dependencies-injection-swift-example \"custom tab bar swiftui\").\nRemember: sometimes with a couple of classes you can avoid to import big frameworks and library into your projects.

In this post we will talk about the Cycles rendering engine. What is exactly Cycles?\nLet's see a quote taken from Blender doc:\n\n> Cycles is Blender’s ray-tracing production render engine.\n\nCycles is a state of the art ray tracing engine built into Blender. We can try to achieve the same level of realism of\nother computer graphics production tools (photorealistic level).  \nLet's start by see how we can activate it. From the menu at the top of the 3D window choose *Cycle Render*. When we do\nthis operation, the render properties tab will change, as a consequence of the fact that Cycles as other option compared\nto the standard *Blender Render*. One of the most important thing to note is that cycles uses the CPU and the GPU of our\ncomputer to render our scenes in interactive mode. This basically means that we can see the final rendered scene and\nnavigate through it. Wonderful :heart_eyes:!!!\n\n![Start the cycles engine](../images/posts/blender-cycles-start.jpg)\n\nHow do we create material for cycles? We can create a material from the same tab we previously saw. When the cycles\nrender is selected the option to customize the material change accordingly. In particular there's a *surface* option\nwhere we can select from a list of BSDF the type of surface BSDF we want. The other option will change accordingly based\non this selection. We can also add texture like for standard material. To do that we simply have to go into the color\noption and select the texture we want.\n\n![Cycles material](../images/posts/blender-cycles-material.jpg)\n\nFor what concern lights, Cycles support different type of lights. The type of lights and their setup are similar to the\none we can find in the standard Blender engine:\n\n* **point**\n* **sun**\n* **spot**\n* **hemi**\n* **area**\n\nWe can also use ambient occlusion to improve the realism of light. We can activate it like we did before under the World\ntab in the properties. That's all my friends for Blender. This was the last post for the \"Blender tutorial\" series.

This is absolutely not true! In this blog post I will show you how I create a component with a custom\nbackground shape, similar to the one I did for a native component ome time ago*\n\n---\n\nFrom time to time, while working on your daily job as a mobile developer, the typical discussion about \"React Native \nvs. Native\" (or, generally speaking, \"<Hybrid framework> vs. Native\") resurfaces,\nigniting passions and sparking endless debates about which one is better.\"  \nMost of the time, native developers hold the belief that certain more advanced views and effects cannot be created \nusing React Native.\nHowever, lately, on the web, you can find some great developers (e.g. [William Candillon](https://www.youtube.com/@wcandillon)) on a mission to demonstrate that this belief is absolutely not true.  \nRecently, I had the opportunity to work on a component that could spark this kind of discussion. Essentially, I had \nto create a text component with a custom-shaped background and coordinated animations within it, similar to the one \nI created [here](/2022/10/03/swiftui-path-svg-scale/) in swift.\nAlthough I may not be as skilled as the developers I mentioned earlier, in this blog post I will demonstrate two \npossible ways to achieve the same result of a pure native component for this type of development.\nTo do this, I will use two different frameworks:\n\n* [React Native Skia](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/), high Performance 2D Graphics framework\n* [React Native SVG](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg), framework for svg drawing \n\nThe component that I will create is shown in the following screenshot, and it is composed by:\n\n* a title section that contains \"daily offers\", with a pink background shape and an animation on the left icon (fire \n  icon)\n* a subtitle section that contains a name of a city, with a white background shape and a pressable component \n  around it \n\nThey will animate in sequence from the top to the bottom in terms of opacity. I will implement it using both the \nframeworks above, to evaluate their usage complexity. \n\n![The component on both platforms: iOS and Android](../images/posts/daily-deals-featured.jpg)\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96wofMjkyKc`\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe implementation of the components in the image and video above is composed of two parts:\n\n* a common component called `DailyDealsHeader`, that is a component that contains the `DailyDealsTitle` component \n  (the title) and the `DailyDealsOrigin` component (the subtitle).\n* Two components that will draw that background using React Native Skia and React Native SVG called .\n  These two components will be sent as props `titleShape` and `originShape` props of `DailyDealsHeader`, and passed \n  with props drilling to the bottom components where I need to draw it.\n\n##### The common parts\n\nThe `DailyDealsHeader` component is the main components.\nIt acts as a container for all the others.\nIt receives from as props `titleShape` and `originShape`, that are the two function used to render the Skia or SVG \nbackgrounds.\nIt receives also the `originCity` and the `onPress` props, needed by the child to act as expected (show a city name \nin the subtitle and react as they are pressed). \n\n```tsx\ntype Props = {\n  originCity: string;\n  onPress: () => void;\n  titleShape: (polygonFeatures: PolygonFeatures) => ReactElement;\n  originShape: (polygonFeatures: PolygonFeatures) => ReactElement;\n};\n\nexport const DailyDealsHeader: FC<Props> = ({\n   titleShape,\n   originShape,\n   originCity,\n   onPress,\n}) => (\n   <View style={styles.header}>\n     <DailyDealsTitle renderShape={titleShape} />\n     <DailyDealsOrigin\n             originCity={originCity}\n             onPress={onPress}\n             renderShape={originShape}\n     />\n   </View>\n);\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  header: {\n    display: 'flex',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    flexDirection: 'column',\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe `DailyDealsTitle`, as you can imagine, renders the title.\nThe title is composed by an `Image`, that has a scale animation created using`react-native-reanimated`, and the \n`Daily Deals` text.\nThis component uses also `DailyDealsBackgroundShape` the component in charge of rendering the background \nreceived as `renderShape` prop.\nThe features of the background are described by the `getPolygonFeatures` function.\nThis function **calculate the background shape proportionally to the width and height of the component itself** (we \nwill see later how). \nThis function will be passed to the `DailyDealsBackgroundShape` that will compose the `renderShape` prop with the \n`PolygonFeatures` to draw the background.\n\n\n```tsx\nimport React, {FC, ReactElement, useEffect} from 'react';\nimport {\n  DailyDealsBackgroundShape,\n  PolygonFeatures,\n} from './DailyDealsBackgroundShape.tsx';\nimport Animated, {\n  useAnimatedStyle,\n  useSharedValue,\n  withDelay,\n  withRepeat,\n  withSequence,\n  withTiming,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\nimport

StyleSheet.create({\n  shapeStyle: {\n    zIndex: 10,\n    elevation: 10,\n  },\n  dailyDealsTitleContent: {\n    display: 'flex',\n    flexDirection: 'row',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    paddingLeft: 8,\n    paddingRight: 4,\n    paddingTop: 8,\n    paddingBottom: 8,\n    gap: 4,\n  },\n  titleLabel: {\n    color: textColor,\n    fontSize: 24,\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    fontFamily: 'Ubuntu-Bold',\n  },\n  fire: {\n    width: FIRE_SIZE,\n    height: FIRE_SIZE,\n    marginLeft: 4,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe `DailyDealsOrigin` component is similar to the previous one, event if it is composed by slightly different \npieces because:\n\n* it should react when pressed (will trigger the `onPress` received from the top)\n* it should draw a different background, described again by the `getPolygonFeatures` function\n\nAs I have shown above, also in this case I used the `DailyDealsBackgroundShape` to compose the `renderShape` prop with \nthe

marginLeft: 4,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNow it's time to see how `DailyDealsBackgroundShape` is implemented. This component renders its children, wrapped in \nan `Animated.View` on the `opacity` property.\nThe most important part of this component is the `{renderShape(polygonFeatures)}` line of code.\nHere I'm composing the rendering function (skia or svg) with the polygon features.\nThe pattern I used in this application to decouple the type of the shape from this component is called \n[\"render prop\"](https://react.dev/reference/react/cloneElement#passing-data-with-a-render-prop).\nDo you remember when I said before that `getPolygonFeatures` is calculating the polygon used as shape \nproportionally to the container?\nThis magic can happen thanks to the implementation of the `onContentLayout` below.\nI get the measures of the `DailyDealsBackgroundShape`, and I pass them `getPolygonFeatures`.\nThis means that `getPolygonFeatures` will always return a polygon shape coherent with its container \n(`DailyDealsBackgroundShape`).\nThe `PolygonFeatures` are composed by:\n\n* the position of the four vertices (it is always a quadrilateral shape, but as a challenge you can try to abstract \n  this part, if you want to have some fun :smirk:) \n* the background size\n\n```tsx\nimport React, {FC, ReactElement, useEffect, useState} from 'react';\nimport Animated, {\n  useSharedValue,\n  withDelay,\n  withTiming,\n} from 'react-native-reanimated';\nimport {\n  LayoutChangeEvent,\n  StyleProp,\n  StyleSheet,\n  View,\n  ViewStyle,\n} from 'react-native';\n\ntype Size = {\n  readonly width: number;\n  readonly height: number;\n};\n\nexport type Point = {\n  readonly x: number;\n  readonly y: number;\n};\n\nexport type PolygonFeatures = {\n  vertices: {\n    topLeft: Point;\n    topRight: Point;\n    bottomRight: Point;\n    bottomLeft: Point;\n  };\n  size: Size;\n};\n\ntype Props = {\n  renderShape: (polygonFeatures: PolygonFeatures) => ReactElement;\n  opacityDelay: number;\n  getPolygonFeatures: (width: number, height: number) => PolygonFeatures;\n  additionalStyle?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n};\n\nexport const DailyDealsBackgroundShape: FC<Props> = ({\n  renderShape,\n  opacityDelay,\n  getPolygonFeatures,\n  additionalStyle,\n  children,\n}) => {\n  const shapeOpacity = useSharedValue(0);\n  const contentOpacity = useSharedValue(0);\n  const [polygonFeatures, setPolygonFeatures] =\n    useState<PolygonFeatures | null>(null);\n\n  const onContentLayout = (event: LayoutChangeEvent) => {\n    const {width, height} = event.nativeEvent.layout;\n    const roundedWidth = Math.round(width);\n    const roundedHeight = Math.round(height);\n\n    setPolygonFeatures(getPolygonFeatures(roundedWidth, roundedHeight));\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    shapeOpacity.value = withDelay(\n      opacityDelay,\n      withTiming(1, {\n        duration: 400,\n      }),\n    );\n    contentOpacity.value = withDelay(\n      opacityDelay + 350,\n      withTiming(1, {\n        duration: 400,\n      }),\n    );\n  }, [contentOpacity, polygonFeatures, shapeOpacity, opacityDelay]);\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View\n      onLayout={onContentLayout}\n      style={[\n        {\n          ...styles.container,\n          opacity: shapeOpacity,\n        },\n        additionalStyle,\n      ]}>\n      {polygonFeatures && (\n        <View style={styles.polygon}>{renderShape(polygonFeatures)}</View>\n      )}\n      <Animated.View style={{opacity: contentOpacity}}>\n        {children}\n      </Animated.View>\n    </Animated.View>\n  );\n};\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    overflow: 'visible',\n    alignSelf: 'flex-start',\n  },\n  polygon: {\n    position: 'absolute',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n##### Svg and Skia components\n\nLet's see how I \"draw\" the background shapes. Both implementations are quite straightforward.  \nThe React Native SVG one composes a string of vertices from the `PolygonFeatures` received.\nThese are passed to a `Polygon` component to make it draw the shape.\nIts container is a `Svg` component that set the canvas size using the one received in the `PolygonFeatures`.\n\n```tsx\nconst svgVertex = (point: Point) => `${point.x},${point.y}`;\n\ntype Props = {\n  polygonFeatures: PolygonFeatures;\n  shapeColor: string;\n};\n\nexport const DailyDealsShapeSvg: FC<Props> = ({\n  polygonFeatures,\n  shapeColor,\n}) => {\n  const {\n    vertices: {topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight},\n    size,\n  } = polygonFeatures;\n\n  const topVertices = `${svgVertex(topLeft)} ${svgVertex(topRight)}`;\n  const bottomVertices = `${svgVertex(bottomRight)} ${svgVertex(bottomLeft)}`;\n  const vertices = `${topVertices} ${bottomVertices}`;\n\n  return (\n    polygonFeatures && (\n      <Svg height={size.height} width={size.width}>\n        <Polygon points={vertices} fill={shapeColor} />\n      </Svg>\n    )\n  );\n};\n```\n\nFor the Skia implementation, I used the `Skia.Path.Make` builder.\nWith this one I created a path from the `PolygonFeatures`, and I passed it to a `Path` component.\nAs for the svg implementation, the container, in this case `Canvas`, set the drawing size received.\n\n```tsx\ntype Props = {\n  polygonFeatures: PolygonFeatures;\n  shapeColor: Color;\n};\n\nexport const DailyDealsShapeSkia: FC<Props> = ({\n  polygonFeatures,\n  shapeColor,\n}) => {\n  const {\n    vertices: {topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight},\n    size,\n  } = polygonFeatures;\n\n  const path = Skia.Path.Make();\n  path.moveTo(topLeft.x, topLeft.y);\n  path.lineTo(topRight.x, topRight.y);\n  path.lineTo(bottomRight.x, bottomRight.y);\n  path.lineTo(bottomLeft.x, bottomLeft.y);\n  path.close();\n\n  return (\n    polygonFeatures && (\n      <Canvas style={{\n                width: size.width,\n                height: size.height,\n              }}>\n        <Path path={path} color={shapeColor} />\n      </Canvas>\n    )\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAs you can see from the implementation above, the more complicated part is outside Skia/SVG. They are simple \ncomponents focused on the drawing part.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find the full implementation of what I described above in this [github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Background-Shape-Skia-Svg). \nI had so much fun learning how to use the libraries above.\nLet's see if in the future I will draw something else with them :rocket:.\n","slug":"/2024/03/02/react-native-skia-svg-background-shape-text/","description":"A lot of mobile developer often complains that React Native is not Native, because it is missing some  features. This is absolutely not true!

Indeed a new standard is emerging that tries to basically close this gap: Progressive Web App, PWA. What is a\nProgressive Web App :heart_eyes:? Let's see how Google defines it on\nits [developer site](https://developers.google.com/ \"google developer pwa\"):\n\n> Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:\n>\n>* Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.\n>* Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.\n>* Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.\n>* This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.\n\nWhat does it basically means? PWAs are web applications that combine the best of the web and the best of native mobile\napps. They can reach a vast user base (as all web apps) but they also have native alike features like:\n\n* they can work offline\n* they can use hardware capabilities and are they able to receive push notifications\n\nSo I started to think: \"Whoah, I can modify my blog/website to become a PWA, so that I can explore this new technology\nand I can also have something that 'feels like an app' for my blog!!!\".  \nSo how is it possible to transform a site built with Jekyll and published on Github Pages in a basic PWA? In this post I\nwill show you how I did it (and this article is part of the PWA described here).  \nTo create a basic PWA I need 3 things:\n\n* publish the site on HTTPS\n* a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/ \"web app manifest\")\n* a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/ \"service worker\")\n\nLet's see in details what I did to get this basic PWA checklist completed :bowtie:.\n\n#### HTTPS\n\nTo have https on my github pages site I had to do...nothing!!!:tada::tada::tada: I already configured the site to be\nHTTPS only using [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). This is the service I chose during the development of the\nfirst version of my site to be used for HTTPS and also as [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).\nThis was too much easy :grin:, let's move on quickly to the next step: the web app manifest.\n\n#### Web App Manifest\n\nThe [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/ \"web app manifest\") is a JSON\nfile that must be deployed in the root of you web application. This JSON is used by user browser about to get some\ninformation about your web application and how it should behave when 'installed' on the user's mobile device or desktop.\nThis manifest is required by Chrome to show the Add to Home Screen prompt.\n\nA typical manifest file includes the following informations:\n\n* `name` and `short_name`, used respectively on the install screen and on the home screen of the user\n* `icons`, that is an array that contains the app icons\n* the `start_url` it should start at when launched\n* `background_color`, used for the splash screen when the app is launched\n* `display`, to tell which browser UI show when the app is launched\n* `theme_color`, that sets the color of the tool bar, and may be reflected in the app's preview in task switchers.\n\nThere are also other options that could be set, like for example the `orientation`, if you want to enforce a specific\norientation of your app. You can find a complete description of the fields above in\nthe [Google Web Fundamentals - Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/ \"Web app manifest\")\narticle. So I created all the assets needed for my web app manifest (a new set of icons of different dimensions) and I\nput them in the root of my website. Below you can find the entire JSON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Chicio Coding\",\n  \"short_name\": \"Chicio\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"assets/images/android-icon-144x144.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"144x144\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"assets/images/android-icon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"assets/images/android-icon-384x384.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"384x384\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"assets/images/android-icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"start_url\": \"./?utm_source=pwa\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#303F9F\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#3F51B5\",\n  \"orientation\": \"portrait\"\n}\n```\n\nOne important thing to note is that not all the platforms adhere to the web app manifest standard. In fact Apple and\nMicrosoft still use some custom meta tags to define the icon of the Progressive Web App. So besides the web app\nmanifest, to make my PWA work the same way on all the platforms I had to add the following meta tag in the head of my\npages.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"57x57\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"60x60\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-60x60.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"72x72\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"76x76\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"114x114\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"120x120\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"144x144\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"152x152\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"167x167\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-167x167.png\">\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/assets/images/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png\">\n<meta name=\"msapplication-config\" content=\"browserconfig.xml\" />\n<meta name=\"msapplication-TileColor\" content=\"#303f9f\">\n<meta name=\"msapplication-TileImage\" content=\"/assets/images/mstile-144x144.png\">\n<meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#303F9F\">\n```\n\nAs you can see there's a list of meta tags named `apple-touch-icon` specific for Apple Devices, and there are also 3\ntags `msapplication-*` specific for Microsoft platforms. For the Microsoft tags, one of them requires\na `browserconfig.xml` that contains, guess what... a list of icons :laughing:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<browserconfig>\n    <msapplication>\n        <tile>\n            <square150x150logo src=\"/assets/images/mstile-150x150.png\"/>\n            <TileColor>#303f9f</TileColor>\n        </tile>\n    </msapplication>\n</browserconfig>\n```\n\n#### Service Worker\n\nA service worker is the heart of a Progressive Web App. Let's see the definition of what is a service worker taken from\nthe [Google Web Fundamentals - Service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/ \"Service Worker\")\n.\n\n> A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync. In the future, service workers might support other things like periodic sync or geofencing. ... is the ability to intercept and handle all the network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses.\n\nWhoa!!! :open_mouth: Basically service workers let your web app inherit some features that are typically found only in a\nnative mobile app:\n\n* push notification\n* offline support\n* background sync\n\nAnyway, there are some particular features of a service worker you must be aware of in order to fully understand how\nthey works:\n\n* you can't access the DOM directly. In order to be able to manipulate the page content, you need to use the\n  worker [postMessage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-worker-postmessage \"worker post message\")\n  api and then manipulate the page change the content if needed (using javascript).\n* service workers are a programmable network proxy, allowing you to control how network requests from your page are\n  handled.\n* service worker don't have a global state, so on each invocation a service worker will not be aware of anything of the\n  previous one (to share data between sessions, you need to use\n  the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API))\n\nSo how do I created the service worker for my blog? I started by adding a `sw.js` file to the root of project. This is\nthe standard position for a service worker source code. Then I added the registration script before the end of the body\nof my pages. Below you can find the registration script.\n\n```html\n<script>\n  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\n    navigator.serviceWorker\n      .register('/sw.js')\n      .then(function() {\n        console.log(\"Service Worker Registered\");\n      });\n  } else {\n    console.log('error register service worker')\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThen I started to write my service worker. To do that, first I studied the lifecycle of a service worker, composed by\nthe following main events:\n\n* `install`, launched when the service worker will be installed\n* `activate`, launched just after the installation process has been completed correctly.\n* `fetch`, launched on each fetch request executed inside the page\n\nSo in the install event I followed the standard approach:\n\n* I opened the cache for my blog pwa with name {% raw %}`chicioCodingCache{% include version.txt %}`{% endraw %}, where\n  version.txt is a file that is automatically filled with the latest tag number on each `npm version` execution.\n* I added to the cache the files needed to make my pwa works (css and js of the site, and in the future also a HTML\n  scaffolding structure :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).\n\nIn the activate event I added a strategy to manage the old caches: I just delete them and I kept only the new one\ncreated during the install phase. Then in the fetch event I decided the cache strategy for all the network request made\ninside my pages. What I chose is basically to return immediately the element if it is present in the cache while at the\nsame time try to update it in the cache. So the next time the user will see the content updated.  \nTo manage the fact that not all the browsers implement the\nentire [Service Worker Cache API](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#cache-objects \"service worker cache api\"), I\nadded a polyfill to manage this inconsistency and imported it with\nthe [WebWorker importScripts() api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts \"webworker import scripts api\")\n.  \nOne last note: I had to put the frontmatter header inside the service worker source code file to let jekyll understand\nthat the file that contains the service worker must be processed. Jekyll in this way will add:\n\n* the cache version number as explained above (`version.txt` include file)\n* the list of js and css urls to be cached in the install events (I generate this urls lists with a script that extracts\n  them from other Jekyll template files and put them inside `service-worker-home-urls.js`, `service-worker-blog-urls.js`\n  and `service-worker-css-urls.js`)\n\nBelow you can find the complete implementation of the service worker.\n\n```javascript\n---\n---\nimportScripts('/cache-polyfill.js');\n\nconst siteCacheName = {% raw %}'chicioCodingCache{% include version.txt %}';{% endraw %}\nconst dependenciesUrls = [\n  \"/favicon.ico\",\n  {% raw %}{% include service-worker-home-urls.js %}{% endraw %}\n  {% raw %}{% include service-worker-blog-urls.js %}{% endraw %}\n  {% raw %}{% include service-worker-css-urls.js %}{% endraw %}\n]\n\nself.addEventListener('install', (event) => {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.open(siteCacheName).then((cache) => {\n      return cache.addAll(dependenciesUrls);\n    })\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.keys().then((cacheNames) => {\n      return Promise.all(\n        cacheNames.filter((cacheName) => {\n          return cacheName !== siteCacheName\n        }).map((cacheName) => {\n          return caches.delete(cacheName);\n        })\n      );\n    })\n  );\n});\n\nself.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.open(siteCacheName).then(async (cache) => {\n      return cache.match(event.request).then((response) => {\n        return response || fetch(event.request).then((response) => {\n          cache.put(event.request, response.clone());\n          return response;\n        });\n      });\n    })\n  );\n});\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nBy adding all the above implementation my blog is now a Progressive Web App (that's right, the article you're reading\npart of a PWA :smirk:). If you want to see the entire source code of my website/blog discussed here you can have a look\nat [this repository](https://github.com/chicio/old.chicio.github.io \"chicio coding repository\").  \nSo now it's time to start to develop you first PWA or transform you website/ web application in PWA.

This is why Native Modules have been created for\nboth [iOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios)\nand [Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android). Sometimes when you integrated React\nNative in an existing app, you will want to be able let your Native Modules bridges communicate with your activities and\nfragment, especially the ones that contain the React Native View. In this post I will show you an architecture to put in\nplace this communication on Android, that will be compatible with all the features of React Native (for example it will\nwork also with the live reload functionality). This is an architecture I put in place with my\ncolleague [Felice Giovinazzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felice-giovinazzo-17277b55/) in our apps\nat [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com\"). Felice is a senior fullstack developer with\nmany years of experiences (he is the \"lastminute\" veteran of our team) and a computer graphics enthusiast like me :\nrevolving_hearts::sparkling_heart:.  \nTo show you this architecture I will create a simple app that show a React Native screen as a modal. I will then\nimplement the close button functionality by calling a native module from the `onPress` on a React Native button. Below\nyou can see the final result.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdNqDQHNjRc`\n\nThe architecture we put in place is based on a **Event Bus** in which the Native Modules bridges notify the subscribed\nActivities/Fragments of the actions to be executed. So each one of them is subscribed to specific events to which they\nare able to respond. We choose [Otto](https://square.github.io/otto/) as event bus library (we don't want to reinvent\nthe wheel :bomb:). Let's start from the `MainActivity`. In it there's only a button with an action to start the React\nNative modal activity.\n\n```java\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n    }\n\n    public void showReactNativeModal(View view) {\n        startActivity(new Intent(this, ReactNativeModalActivity.class));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `ReactNativeModalActivity` is an `Activity` with the setup needed to launch a React Native context. This activity is\nregistered to the event bus to be able to listen to events from the Native Modules bridges. In this case the activity is\nsubscribed to just one event with the\nmethod `@Subscribe public void close(ReactNativeModalBridge.CloseModalEvent event)`.\n\n```java\npublic class ReactNativeModalActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {\n\n    private final int OVERLAY_PERMISSION_REQ_CODE = 8762;\n    private ReactRootView mReactRootView;\n    private ReactInstanceManager mReactInstanceManager;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        registerToReactEvents();\n        askReactDrawingPermission();\n        setupReactView();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onDestroy() {\n        super.onDestroy();\n        unregisterToReactEvents();\n\n        if (mReactInstanceManager != null) {\n            mReactInstanceManager.onHostDestroy(this);\n        }\n        if (mReactRootView != null) {\n            mReactRootView.unmountReactApplication();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void registerToReactEvents() {\n        ((NativeModulesApplication)getApplication())\n                .getBus()\n                .register(this);\n    }\n\n    private void unregisterToReactEvents() {\n        ((NativeModulesApplication)getApplication())\n                .getBus()\n                .unregister(this);\n    }\n\n    @Subscribe\n    public void close(ReactNativeModalBridge.CloseModalEvent event) {\n        finish();\n    }\n\n    private void askReactDrawingPermission() {\n        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\n            if (!Settings.canDrawOverlays(this)) {\n                Intent intent = new Intent(\n                        Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION,\n                        Uri.parse(\"package:\" + getPackageName())\n                );\n                startActivityForResult(intent, OVERLAY_PERMISSION_REQ_CODE);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void setupReactView() {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nNow let's have a look at Native Module created for the app, the `ReactNativeModalBridge`. In this bridge there just one\nreact method, `closeModal`. This is the one called from the React Native JS side. In this method we are sending an event\nof type `CloseModalEvent`. The `ReactNativeModalActivity` is subscribed to this type of event (as we saw above). This\nbasically means that when the `closeModal` bridge method will be called from the React Native Javascript code a new\nevent `CloseModalEvent` is generated and the `ReactNativeModalActivity` will execute the subscribed method defined in\nit. We have all setup to have our Native Modules communication with our activities (and eventually fragment with the\nsame approach if we need them :neckbeard:).\n\n```java\npublic class ReactNativeModalBridge extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n    public ReactNativeModalBridge(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\n        super(reactContext);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getName() {\n        return this.getClass().getSimpleName();\n    }\n\n    @ReactMethod\n    public void closeModal() {\n        final Activity currentActivity = getCurrentActivity();\n        currentActivity.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                ((NativeModulesApplication) currentActivity.getApplication())\n                        .getBus()\n                        .post(new CloseModalEvent());\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public class CloseModalEvent { }\n}\n```\n\nNow it's time to see the javascript code. Below you can see the `ReactNativeModal` component. Inside this component\nthere is a call to the native module `NativeModules.ReactNativeModalBridge.closeModal()` described above. In this way\nthe modal will be closed directly from the native side.\n\n```jsx\nclass ReactNativeModal extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.hello}>Hello modal!</Text>\n        <Text style={styles.message}>\n          I'm a react native component. Click on the button to close me using native function.\n        </Text>\n        <Button\n          title={\"Close me\"}\n          onPress={() => NativeModules.ReactNativeModalBridge.closeModal()}\n        />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's all for our native modules communication architecture on Android.

In this post we will talk about armatures and character rigging.  \nLet's start from armatures. Armatures are composed of bones. We can create bones by selecting *Add -> Armature -> Single\nBone*. Every bone is compose of:\n\n* a base\n* a body\n* a tip\n\nBy selecting the body we can move the entire bone into a new position. By selecting the base or the tip we can move just\none of the end of the bone. When a bone is selected two new tab becomes available in the properties panel:\n\n* the armature tab\n* the bone tab\n\nLet's see the armature tab first. First we have a the display options, to manage how the bone is displayed. We can also\nshow the name, the color and more important we can activate the X-Ray mode that let us see the bone through the\ncharacter.\n\n![Add bones](../images/posts/blender-bones.jpg)\n\nTo create a complete armature we have some tools similar to the one we previously seen for modeling. After selecting\nedit mode, in the left panel of the 3D window we have the options extrude and subdivide that let us create a complete\nskeleton for a character. In the scene we will find our armature object with all the bones connected.\n\n![Add armature](../images/posts/blender-armature.jpg)\n\nWe can now start to add the armature to an object. To do that we just have to place/create the bones inside our object.\nAfter that we select the object and the bones (in this specific order), and we choose from the menu at the bottom of the\n3D window the option Object -> Parent -> Armature Deform. After this operation, we can go into pose mode (by choosing it\nin the menu at the bottom of the 3D window). If we move one of our bones in this mode, the part of the object/mesh that\ncontains that bone will move accordingly.\n\n![Set armature](../images/posts/blender-set-armature.jpg)\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpkMgUqWZJo`\n\nSometimes we will also need to constraint a bone to the move of other bones. Instead of doing it manually, we can use\nInverse kinematics. To be more clear this is an extract of the blender doc:\n\n> IK simplifies the animation process, and makes it possible to make more advanced animations with lesser effort. IK allows you to position the last bone in a bone chain and the other bones are positioned automatically\n\nWe can add an inverse kinematic constraint on a bone by choosing it from the menu under the Bone constraint tab in the\nproperties panel. This tab will appear only when we are in pose mode.\n\n![Inverse kinematics](../images/posts/blender-inverse-kinematics.jpg)\n\nAfter setting bones, armature and inverse kinematics we are ready to animate our character. To do that, we just need to\nbe in Pose mode and set the keyframes as we did for standard animation.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5m1rnjT6Rw`\n\nThat's all for character rigging. In the next post we will talk about the rendering engine Cycles.\n","slug":"/2019/03/28/blender-tutorial-14-armatures-character-rigging/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about character rigging.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"702e0966-b7fe-5b8c-a2c9-c290b6c00c2e":{"title":"Intersection Observer API: speed up your web applications with lazy loading","content":"\n*Intersection Observer can improve your web applications performance by helping you to implement lazy loading of\nimages.*\n\n---\n\nIn the last few months I worked hard to improved the page speed of my website (yeah, the one you're visiting right now :\nheart_eyes:). I improved all my client side code in order to be able to reach a performance score above 90 points\non [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), the official Google Chrome tool to measure\nperformance,\naccessibility, [progressive web apps](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"progressive web app\")\ncompliance and more on your web application. One of the last thing that was contained in the report was a warning about\noffscreen images, like the one contained in the following screenshot:\n\n![The lighthouse audit suggestion to load offscreen images asynchronous only when they are really needed (when they are visible in the viewport)](../images/posts/intersection-observer-offscreen-audit.jpg)\n\nSo I followed the link contained in the report that points to a page where are contained\nthe [official Google Guidelines about offscreen images loading](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/offscreen-images)\n. The main topic of the page is\nthe [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) and how it\ncan help you to load specific content only when it becomes visible in the viewport. I found also another article on the\nofficial Google developer website that explains in details how to leverage the power of Intersection Observer to lazy\nload the images in your web applications. So as you may imagine I \"accepted the challenge\" (like\nonly [Barney Stinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson) in how I met your mother is used to do :\nstuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and I started to implement the lazy load of images for my website.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nFirst of all let's start by creating a function called `lazyLoadImages`. This function takes two parameter:\n\n* selector, that is a string that I will use to select all the\n  document [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element \"document element\") objects that I\n  wanted to observe\n* loadCompleted, a function that will be executed after the image has been downloaded\n\nThis function will create a new instance of the `IntersectionObserver` object from\nthe [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). This object\nconstructor takes two parameter:\n\n* a callback, that is the function called when an object become visible given the current configuration\n* a configuration options, that let the developer customize how the Intersection Observer calculate the intersection\n  with the viewport\n\nAfter the creation of the `IntersectionObserver` object I attached it to the DOM elements I want to observe by calling\nits `observer(element)` method on the\ndocument [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element \"document element\") objects selected\nusing [querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll \"document querySelectorAll\")\nmethod with the `selector` received as parameter.\n\n```javascript\nconst lazyLoadImages = (selector, loadCompleted) => {\n  const intersectionObserver: IntersectionObserver = new IntersectionObserver(\n    (entries, observer) => onIntersection(entries, observer, loadCompleted),\n    { rootMargin: '50px 0px', threshold: 0.01 }\n  )\n  document.querySelectorAll(selector).forEach(image => intersectionObserver.observe(image))\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see in the snippet above, in the intersection callback I'm calling the `onIntersection` function. What does\nit do? This function checks the `IntersectionObserverEntry` received from the Intersection Observer as parameter. If\na `target` `Element` is inside the viewport it would have the `intersectionRatio` > 0. When this happen I can remove the\nobserver and start the load of the image with the `loadImage` function.\n\n```javascript\nconst onIntersection = (entries, observer, loadCompleted) => {\n  entries.forEach(entry => {\n    if (entry.intersectionRatio > 0) {\n      observer.unobserve(entry.target)\n      loadImage(entry.target, loadCompleted)\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThe `loadImage` function downloads the image by setting the image src field with the data contained in the `data-src`\nfield. At the end of the download I remove the `lazy` css class, that I used to hide the image until it has been\ndownload. Then the `loadCompleted` function is called, where the caller can do anything it want with the image (for\nexample I'm doing a custom animation in order to avoid a flash out effect when the image is show).\n\n```javascript\nconst loadImage = (image, loadCompleted) => {\n  image.src = image.dataset.src\n  image.onload = () => {\n    removeCssClass(image, 'lazy')\n    loadCompleted(image)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is the final script with the complete flow.\n\n```javascript\nimport 'intersection-observer'\nimport { removeCssClass } from './css-class'\n\nconst lazyLoadImages = (selector, loadCompleted) => {\n  const intersectionObserver: IntersectionObserver = new IntersectionObserver(\n    (entries, observer) => onIntersection(entries, observer, loadCompleted),\n    { rootMargin: '50px 0px', threshold: 0.01 }\n  )\n  document.querySelectorAll(selector).forEach(image => intersectionObserver.observe(image))\n}\n\nconst onIntersection = (entries, observer, loadCompleted) => {\n  entries.forEach(entry => {\n    if (entry.intersectionRatio > 0) {\n      observer.unobserve(entry.target)\n      loadImage(entry.target, loadCompleted)\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nconst loadImage = (image, loadCompleted) => {\n  image.src = image.dataset.src\n  image.onload = () => {\n    removeCssClass(image, 'lazy')\n    loadCompleted(image)\n  }\n}\n\nexport { lazyLoadImages }\n```\n\nThere's still one thing that I didn't discuss yet. How can we support this type of lazy loading for the browser that\ndoesn't still have implemented the `IntersectionObserver` API? The answer is\nthe [Intersection Observer Polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill). I installed it\nas a dependency of my project.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save intersection-observer\n```\n\nThis [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming) \"polyfill programming\") exposes an ad hoc\nimplementation in vanilla javascript of the Intersection Observer, or it exposes the current browser implementation if\nit is already in place for the browser that the user is using.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIntersection Observer is a powerful API. It lets you implement lazy loading for resources loading and reach performance\nand architectural application pattern that I had a chance to see only in mobile native apps. The web is filling the gap\nwith native apps, and Intersection Observer are another demonstration that the 90% of the existing native mobile apps\ncould become powerful web apps. As a consequence of the fact that in my daily job I'm still a native mobile app\ndeveloper, I'm still following the iOS, Android and React Native scene and I'm still studying all the new tools and SDKs\nimprovement released by Apple, Google and Facebook. But, you know, technology goes fast I have to be prepared for the\nfuture :relaxed:. Sooo, long live Intersection Observer!!! Web applications will be much more performant with your\nhelp :green_heart:.\n","slug":"/2019/05/08/intersection-observer/","description":"Intersection Observer can improve your web application performance by helping you to implement lazy loading of resources inside your web pages.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"712e39d2-d08f-52d5-b329-a2d95d308922":{"title":"Create a Swift library compatible with the Swift Package Manager for macOS and Linux","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about how to create a Swift library compatible with macOS and Linux.*\n\n---\n\nA few times ago I published [ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor), a Swift library to read and modify\nthe ID3 tag of mp3 files (I described it\nin [this previous post](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2018/05/08/id3tageditor-swift-read-write-id3-tag-mp3/ \"id3 tag editor\"))\n. This library was compatible with iOS, Apple TV, watchOS and macOS. Then one day a user of my library **opened a new\nissue on the library github repo** with title \"Build Error\" and a description of a **build error on Linux**.\n\n![An error on the linux build of ID3TagEditor reported by a user](../images/posts/spm-id3tageditor-linux-error.jpg)\n\nThe library had a simple `Package.swift`, but honestly I never tested it with the Swift Package Manager (SPM) on Linux\nnor on macOS :sweat_smile: (this was the only feature that I didn't test :sweat_smile:). So I though: \"It's time to add\nfull support for the Swift Package Manager to ID3TagEditor and port it also on Linux!!!!\" :sparkling_heart: In this post\nI will describe how you can create a Swift library package for the Swift Package Manager compatible with macOS and Linux\nfor an existing project. Obviously, I will show you the entire process using\nmy [ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor) as example.  \nFirst of all, if you are starting with a new library project, you will use the following SPM `init` command:\n\n```shell\nswift package init --type library\n```\n\nThis command will create all the files and folders you need to develop your library. But in my case, I was working on an\nexisting project. This is why I created all the needed files manually and I will describe them in details so you can\nunderstand better the meaning of each one of them.  \nThe first file needed is the `Package.swift`. This file must be created in the root folder of your project. This file\ncontains some Swift code that defines the properties of the project using the `PackageDescription` module API. At the\nmoment of this writing there are 3 API versions of the PackageDescription API:\n\n* [Version 3](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/b73299ef84e1e55c789052d0d1eafec30a95a805/Documentation/PackageDescriptionV3.md)\n* [Version 4](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/b73299ef84e1e55c789052d0d1eafec30a95a805/Documentation/PackageDescriptionV4.md)\n* [Version 4.2](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/b73299ef84e1e55c789052d0d1eafec30a95a805/Documentation/PackageDescriptionV4_2.md)\n\nFor my [ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor) I used\nthe [Version 4.2](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/b73299ef84e1e55c789052d0d1eafec30a95a805/Documentation/PackageDescriptionV4_2.md)\n.\n\n ```swift\n // swift-tools-version:4.2\n\n import PackageDescription\n\n let package = Package(\n     name: \"ID3TagEditor\",\n     products: [\n         .library(\n             name: \"ID3TagEditor\",\n             targets: [\"ID3TagEditor\"]\n         ),\n     ],\n     dependencies: [],\n     targets: [\n         .target(\n             name: \"ID3TagEditor\",\n             dependencies: [],\n             path: \"./Source\"\n         ),\n         .testTarget(\n             name: \"ID3TagEditorTests\",\n             dependencies: [\"ID3TagEditor\"],\n             path: \"./Tests\",\n             exclude: [\n                 \"Parsing/Frame/Content/Size/ID3FrameContentSizeParserTest.swift\",\n                 \"Parsing/Frame/Content/Operation/ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperationTest.swift\",\n                 \"Parsing/Frame/Size/ID3FrameSizeParserTest.swift\",\n                 \"Parsing/Tag/Size/ID3TagSizeParserTest.swift\",\n                 \"Parsing/Tag/Version/ID3TagVersionParserTest.swift\",\n                 \"Acceptance/ID3TagEditorTestAcceptanceTest.swift\",\n                 \"Mp3/Mp3FileReaderTest.swift\"\n             ]\n         ),\n     ],\n     swiftLanguageVersions: [.v4_2]\n )\n ```\n\nLet's see in details the meaning of each option:\n\n* `name`, the name of the package\n* `products`, the list of all products in the package. You can have `executable` or `library` products. In my case I\n  have `library` product and for that I have to specify:\n    * `name`, the name of the product\n    * `targets`, the targets which are supposed to be used by other packages, i.e. the public API of a library package\n* `dependencies`, a list of `package` dependencies for our package. At the moment ID3TagEditor doesn't have any\n  dependencies so I declared an empty array.\n* `targets`, the list of targets in the package. In my case I have two target:\n    * `ID3TagEditor`, that is the main target of the library and is a classic `.target`. For this target you specify its\n      name, its dependencies and the path to the source files. In my case I have everything inside the `Source` folder.\n    * `ID3TagEditorTests`, that is the `.testTarget` of the library. For this target I had to specify an\n      additional `exclude` option. The tests excluded contains some references to bundle resources, **and at the moment\n      of this writing the SPM doesn't support resource bundles**.\n* `swiftLanguageVersions`, that contains the set of supported Swift language versions.\n\nNext I had to create a `XCTestManifests.swift` file inside the `Tests` folder. This file contains an extension for\neach `XCTestCase` subclass I included in my test target. This extension contains an array `__allTest` that exposes a\nlist of all my test methods inside my `XCTestCase` subclasses. At the end of this file you can find a `__allTests()`\nfunction that pass all the test methods to the `testCase()` utility function.  `__allTests()` and `testCase` are\navailable only on Linux platform (and in fact the `__allTests()` function is wrapped in a conditional\ncheck `#if !os(macOS)`). Below you can see a part of the `XCTestManifests.swift` file for the `ID3TagEditor` library.\n\n```swift\nimport XCTest\n\nextension ID3AlbumArtistFrameCreatorTest {\n    static let __allTests = [\n        (\"testFrameCreationWhenThereIsAnAlbumArtist\", testFrameCreationWhenThereIsAnAlbumArtist),\n        (\"testNoFrameCreationWhenThereIsNoAlbumArtist\", testNoFrameCreationWhenThereIsNoAlbumArtist),\n    ]\n}\n\nextension ID3AlbumFrameCreatorTest {\n    static let __allTests = [\n        (\"testFrameCreationWhenThereIsAnAlbum\", testFrameCreationWhenThereIsAnAlbum),\n        (\"testNoFrameCreationWhenThereIsNoAlbum\", testNoFrameCreationWhenThereIsNoAlbum),\n    ]\n}\n\nextension ID3ArtistFrameCreatorTest {\n    static let __allTests = [\n        (\"testFrameCreationWhenThereIsAnArtist\", testFrameCreationWhenThereIsAnArtist),\n        (\"testNoFrameCreationWhenThereIsNoArtist\", testNoFrameCreationWhenThereIsNoArtist),\n    ]\n}\n\n//other extensions, one for each unit test class...\n...\n\n#if !os(macOS)\npublic func __allTests() -> [XCTestCaseEntry] {\n    return [\n        testCase(ID3AlbumArtistFrameCreatorTest.__allTests),\n        testCase(ID3AlbumFrameCreatorTest.__allTests),\n        testCase(ID3ArtistFrameCreatorTest.__allTests),\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n#endif\n```\n\nNext I created a `LinuxMain.swift` file in the root folder of my ID3TagEditor project. This file loads all the test on\nLinux (using the functions and extensions defined in the previous `XCTestManifests.swift` file).\n\n```swift\nimport XCTest\n\nimport ID3TagEditorTests\n\nvar tests = [XCTestCaseEntry]()\ntests += ID3TagEditorTests.__allTests()\n\nXCTMain(tests)\n```\n\nNow I was ready to test `ID3TagEditor` using the SPM on macOS and Linux. To do this I used Ubuntu as distro. The distro\nversion used at the moment of this writing is the 18.04 LTS.  \nFirst of all, how do I install Swift on linux? I downloaded the Swift release for Linux from\nthe [Swift download page](https://swift.org/download/ \"swift download page\"). The version I used is the one you can find\nat [this link](https://swift.org/builds/swift-4.2.1-release/ubuntu1804/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE/swift-4.2.1-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04.tar.gz)\n. Then I installed the additional packages `clang` and `libicu-dev` with the following shell command.\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install clang libicu-dev\n```\n\nThen I extracted from the archive previously downloaded the Swift release folder and I added to my shell environment\nvariable `PATH` the path to /usr/bin folder contained inside the this release folder.\n\n```shell\ntar xzf swift-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz\n\n//Add this to your shell profile file\nexport PATH=/<path to the Swift release folder>/usr/bin:\"${PATH}\"\n```\n\nThe setup was done. Now I was able to test  `ID3TagEditor` as a SPM library on Linux. To do this I created a new project\ninside the demo folder of the ID3TagEditor project called `Demo Ubuntu`. This is an executable SPM project that\nhas `ID3TagEditor` as package dependencies. The executable is a command line application that opens a mp3 file, parses\nits ID3 tag and print it to the standard output. To test my work I just cloned the `ID3TagEditor` on Linux (and also on\nmacOS :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and launched the following commands in the root folder of the `Demo Ubuntu`\nproject:\n\n```shell\nswift build\nswift run\n```\n\nBelow you can see some screenshot taken from both Linux and macOS that shows the final output of the demo `Demo Ubuntu`\nafter you execute the `swift run` command.\n\n![ID3TagEditor now works as expected on Ubuntu](../images/posts/spm-id3tageditor-demo-linux.jpg)\n\n![ID3TagEditor works as expected also on macOS](../images/posts/spm-id3tageditor-demo-macos.jpg)\n\nCool! Now the ID3TagEditor is fully compatible with the SPM and could be used in Swift applications for both macOS and\nLinux. You can see the entire codebase of the `ID3TagEditor`\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor).

During the upgraded I\ndiscovered that now you can bundle reources with your Swift package. In this post I will show you how you can do this,\nand also a interesting trick in order to be able to build a project as a Swift Package and as a standard project from\nXcode.*\n\n---\n\nIn the last weeks I started to work again on\nmy [ID3TagEditor](/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/ \"id3tag id3 id3tageditor\") library. Before starting to\nadd new interesting features (do you wanna see the roadmap? check\nthe [kanban board](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor/projects/1 \"ID3TagEditor projects\") or\nthe [milestones](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor/milestones)) I did the usual upgrade to the latest build tools\nreleased in the new Xcode 12. One new interesting feature included in this release ( Swift tools version 5.3) is the\nability to bundle resources with a Swift package. Before this release to bundle resources in a Swift package you had to\nuse weird tricks and hackings. So let's see how you can add the suppport for bundling resources by using my ID3TagEditor\nlibrary as example.  \nSpecifically, I will show you how I can execute all my test suite, including some acceptance tests that uses mp3 and\nimages resources to check the correctness of the ID3 tag added by ID3TagEditor.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nTo support the bundling of resources, the first thing to do is to upgraded the swift tools used to build your package.\nTo do this, you just need to change the comment at the top of the `Package.swift`.\n\n```swift\n// swift-tools-version:5.3\n\n//...other code\n```\n\nIn my ID3TagEditor I have some acceptance tests that uses some mp3 files and some images that I use to check that\nID3TagEditor works as expected. Before the Swift tools 5.3 I was disabling these tests on the Linux platform (that\nsupports only the SwiftPM way to bundle libraries). Now there's a new Swift package `targets(...)`\nand `testTargets(...)` function parameter called `resources` that you can use to load resources.  \nThe `resources` parameter takes as value a list of resource process rules as input. You can choose between two type of\nrules:\n\n* **process rule**. You can create this rule by using\n  the `static func process(_ path: String, localization: Resource.Localization? = nil) -> Resource` function (you can\n  find the offical\n  documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/resource/3554515-process)). This rule\n  let you process the resource according to the platform you’re building the package for. This basically means that the\n  build tools will optimize some files based on the type and the platform (e.g. images will be optimized if the target\n  platform is iOS). You can also support different rules based on different locale/languages.\n\n* **copy rules**. You can create this rule by using the `static func copy(_ path: String) -> Resource` function (you can\n  find the offical documentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/resource/3516880-copy))\n  . This rule let you bundle your resources as they are without any optimization.\n\nBoth rule functions above accept a `_ path: String` parameter. This could be:\n\n* a path to a specific file\n* a path to a specific folder\n\nGiven all this information I was ready to add the resources to my test target and enable the acceptance tests for the\nSwiftPM build (so now they were available on Linux too :relaxed:). So I added the `resources` parameter to\nthe `testTarget` call of my ID3TagEditor. The input value is a an array with just 1 rule: a `process` rule that takes as\nparameter the `Examples` folder, that is the place where I have all the resources (mp3 and images) used by the\nID3TagEditor acceptance tests. Below you can find the complete `Packages.swift` file.\n\n``` swift\n// swift-tools-version:5.3\n\nimport PackageDescription\n\nlet package = Package(\n    name: \"ID3TagEditor\",\n    products: [\n        .library(\n            name: \"ID3TagEditor\",\n            targets: [\"ID3TagEditor\"]\n        )\n    ],\n    dependencies: [],\n    targets: [\n        .target(\n            name: \"ID3TagEditor\",\n            dependencies: [],\n            path: \"./Source\",\n            exclude: [\"Info.plist\"]\n        ),\n        .testTarget(\n            name: \"ID3TagEditorTests\",\n            dependencies: [\"ID3TagEditor\"],\n            path: \"./Tests\",\n            exclude: [\"Utils/PathLoaderXcodeProj.swift\", \"Info.plist\"],\n            resources: [.process(\"Examples\")]\n        )\n    ],\n    swiftLanguageVersions: [.v5]\n)\n```\n\nNow the question is: how do you use/load the resources bundled with your target? When you build a Swift Package the\nbuild tools will automatically generate a `resource_bundle_accessor` file. This file exposes a new `Bundle.module`\nproperty that contains the bundle available for the package based on the environment you're building the source code:\n\n* if you build the package when is linked to the app, `Bundle.module` will contain the `Bundle.main.resourceURL`\n* if you build the package when is linked to a framework, `Bundle.module` will contain\n  the `Bundle(for: BundleFinder.self).resourceURL`\n* if you build the package from the command line, `Bundle.module` will contain the `Bundle.main.bundleURL`\n\n```swift\nimport class Foundation.Bundle\n\nprivate class BundleFinder {}\n\nextension Foundation.Bundle {\n    /// Returns the resource bundle associated with the current Swift module.\n    static var module: Bundle = {\n        let bundleName = \"ID3TagEditor_ID3TagEditorTests\"\n\n        let candidates = [\n            // Bundle should be present here when the package is linked into an App.\n            Bundle.main.resourceURL,\n\n            // Bundle should be present here when the package is linked into a framework.\n            Bundle(for: BundleFinder.self).resourceURL,\n\n            // For command-line tools.\n            Bundle.main.bundleURL,\n        ]\n\n        for candidate in candidates {\n            let bundlePath = candidate?.appendingPathComponent(bundleName + \".bundle\")\n            if let bundle = bundlePath.flatMap(Bundle.init(url:)) {\n                return bundle\n            }\n        }\n        fatalError(\"unable to find bundle named ID3TagEditor_ID3TagEditorTests\")\n    }()\n}\n```\n\nSo in the case of ID3TagEditor, when I **open and build it as a Swift Package from Xcode** or **build it from the\ncommand line** the `Bundle.module` will contain the correct bundle. As a consequence I can\ncall `Bundle.module.path(forResource: <resource name>, ofType: <file type>)` to get the path to the resources bundled\nwith the ID3TagEditor test target and load/use them in my tests. In fact I created a `PathLoader` class that I use in my\nacceptance tests to load my test resources.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nclass PathLoader {\n    func pathFor(name: String, fileType: String) -> String {\n        return Bundle.module.path(forResource: name, ofType: fileType)!\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBelow you can find a screenshot that shows the successfull execution of the tests after opening the ID3TagEditor as a\nSwift Package from Xcode.\n\n![Now I can run my ID3TagEditor acceptance tests when I open it as a Swift package in Xcode](../images/posts/open-as-package-xcode-id3tageditor.jpg)\n\nThere's still one problem with this setup. ID3TagEditor is configured also as a Xcode workspace, because there are some\nrelated demo app that are contained in the repository and I need a way to manage them while developing the library. If I\ntry to build the ID3TagEditor from the workspace view it will not compile. Why? Because `resource_bundle_accessor`\nfile (the one I shown you above) is not automatically generated if you build the swift package as project of a workspace\nand the `PathLoader` class I shown you above contains the error `Type 'Bundle' has no member 'module'`. What can I do? I\nsimply created a new version of the `PathLoader` class that gets the bundle correctly using\nthe `Bundle(for: type(of: self))` constructor where `self` is the test class that is calling the `PathLoader`. Then I\nremoved the from the tests target the file that contains the `PathLoader` implementation for the SwiftPM build tools and\nI added to them only the new implementation, that I putted in a separated file called `PathLoaderXcodeProj.swift`. On\nthe contrary in the `Packagkage.swift` above you can see that I excluded from the test target the implementation used by\nXcode (see `exclude: [\"Utils/PathLoaderXcodeProj.swift\", \"Info.plist\"],`). In this way I'm able to run all my tests\nwithout any error. Below you can find some screenshot with the setup I have just described to you.\n\n![The implementation of the PathLoader class for SwiftPM](../images/posts/path-loader-swiftpm.jpg)\n![The implementation of the PathLoader class for Xcode](../images/posts/path-loader-xcode.jpg)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find more details about SwiftPM and bundling resources with it in\nthe [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package \"resources swift swiftpm\")\n. As you can see Apple is investing a lot of resources in improving its build tools ecosystem and make the life of\ndevelopers easier. Even if I\nstill [hope that Apple will finally fully embrace PWA](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"progressive web apps\") (\nso that a lot of useless shitty apps that can be web apps can disappear :smirk:), it's good to see that developers (of\ntrue useful native apps :grin:) will enjoy in using these new tools to build their apps :heart_eyes:.\n","slug":"/2020/10/19/swift-package-manager-resources/","description":"Recently I upgraded my ID3TagEditor swift package to the latest Swift tools version (5.3).

When I started to work\nat [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") my knowledge of the Android platform\nwas very limited. But... [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") is\nan [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development \"agile software development\")\ncompany and one of the technique we use during our development workflow\nis [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming \"pair programming\"): two developers work at the\nsame feature on the same workstation. As reported on Wikipedia, one of the the main advantages of pair programming is\nknowledge sharing:\n\n> Knowledge is constantly shared between pair programmers, whether in the industry or in a classroom, many sources suggest that students show higher confidence when programming in pairs, and many learn whether it be from tips on programming language rules to overall design skill. In \"promiscuous pairing\", each programmer communicates and works with all the other programmers on the team rather than pairing only with one partner, which causes knowledge of the system to spread throughout the whole team. Pair programming allows the programmers to examine their partner's code and provide feedback which is necessary to increase their own ability to develop monitoring mechanisms for their own learning activities.\n\nThis is why I started to work with my\ncolleague [Francesco Bonfadelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbonfadelli/ \"Francesco Bonfadelli\"), a senior Android, iOS\nand Backend developer. During our pair programming sessions I learned a lot about developing mobile apps for the Android\nplatform. One of the thing I learned in the first few days is the difference between the official IDEs: Android Studio\nand Xcode. After seeing the coding speed that Francesco was able to achieve during an Android coding session, and how\nmuch slower it is to do the same things in Xcode for iOS, I realized how much more advanced is Android Studio with its\nset of refactoring features in comparison with Xcode.  \nIn this post I will briefly analyzed some IDEs commonly used for mobile application development focusing on the coding\nspeed that is possible to achieve by using them and I will explain to you why, at the time of this writing, I started to\nprefer the JetBrains IDEs family (not only for mobile application development :bowtie:).\n\n### Xcode\n\nI always loved Xcode. I started to use it 8 years ago and it's still here with me during my daily job. It opens in a few\nseconds and you can start to code very quickly. But.... what happens when your app code start to increase in terms of\ncomplexity and you need to do a simple refactoring operation? Does it help you in some way when it need to create a new\nclass/property? Does it help you when you need to navigate in your code and you need to jump quickly from one class to\nanother? Well, to be honest it doesn't help you so much. Even a simple renaming could become a painful operation,\nespecially if you have a project with mixed Swift/Objective-C parts. Everything must be done manually. Consider for\nexample this list of mixed code creation/refactoring operations:\n\n* create a new class\n* instantiate it and keep it as a local variable\n* add a method to the previous class\n* add a parameter to the method previously created\n* extract the local variable as a property of controller in which I created it\n\nIn the following video I will try to do these operations in Xcode. At the time of this writing the available Xcode\nversion is 9.2.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsuS8UoSS1A`\n\n**More than 2 minutes to implement all the stuff in the above list.**\nReally slow, isn't it?!?? :fearful:\n\n### Android Studio\n\nBefore [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\"), I had used Android Studio just a\nfew times for some very simple Android apps. Then I started to work\nwith [Francesco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbonfadelli/ \"Francesco Bonfadelli\") and he introduced me to the power of\nJetBrains IDEs. This IDE gives you the ability to navigate quickly in you source code, create and modify classes, and\nallows you to do a lot of other refactoring operations without leaving the keyboard! Basically you can write code and\nforget about your mouse!! :open_mouth:. The list of keyboard shortcuts you can use in your development flow is endless.\nYou can find the complete\nlist [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/keyboard-shortcuts/ \"Android studio keyboard shortcut\").\nLet's try to do the exact same operations I did before with Xcode, and I also add a rename of the class created at the\nend of all the previous operation. At the time of this writing the available Android Studio version is 3.0.1.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsuS8UoSS1A`\n\n**Only 50 seconds and I did all the stuff (and I wasn't pushing hard on the keyboard.. .:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)\n.**\nAs you can see, Android Studio gives you the ability to write code at the speed of light!!! :flushed:.\n\n### AppCode\n\nAs you can image, after working a few hours with Android Studio, I started to wonder if there's an IDE that let me setup\nthe same write code style and workflow. Here another colleague that I worked\nwith, [Tommaso Resti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommaso-resti-0ab5285a/ \"Tommaso Resti\"), a senior iOS and Android\ndeveloper, showed me AppCode for the first time. This is another IDE from JetBrains for iOS development. It allows you\nto improve your development speed by allowing you to use some of the refactoring tools that you can find in Android\nStudio. However it's not all peace and light in this case. Some of the refactoring tools are not available for Swift and\nyou will still need Xcode to work on Xib and Storyboard (the JetBrains team developed a plugin for interface builder,\nbut that has been discontinued). Anyway, if you start to get used to the Android Studio writing code workflow, you will\nfeel at home with AppCode :relaxed:.\n\n### Final thoughts\n\nAndroid Studio and AppCode are based on IntelliJ IDEA, the famous Java IDE from JetBrains. But that's half of the story:\nJetBrains IDE family is really big. You can find an IDE for each of your favourite language:\n\n* CLion, for C and C++\n* PhpStorm\n* PyCharm\n* RubyMine for Ruby\n* GoLand for GO\n* Rider for C#\n\nSo no worries: if you want to start to improve you coding speed probably there's an IDE for your favourite language.\nXcode will always have a special place in my heart. I will still continue to use it in my daily job as a mobile\ndeveloper. But... the coding speed I gained with the JetBrains IDEs could not be ignored :smiling_imp:. This is why I\nstarted to prefer them :heart:.\n","slug":"/2018/01/16/ide-refactoring-android-studio-xcode-appcode-webstorm-jetbrains/","description":"In this post I will compare the coding speed that it is possible to achieve in some JetBrains IDEs and XCode, in terms of code creation and refactoring.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni","tommaso-resti","francesco-bonfadelli"]},"739cf7ec-ebdd-5f0e-84ee-1c3657110154":{"title":"Blender tutorial: advanced modeling","content":"\n*In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about advanced modeling in Blender.*\n\n---\n\nIn the [previous post of the series \"Blender tutorial\"](/2018/06/02/blender-tutorial-4-modeling-basics-part-2/) we\ntalked about the basics of modeling in Blender. In this post we will study Blender advanced modeling tools.  \nLet's start from **modifiers**. All the operation we saw in the previous modeling post were all \"one time operation\":\nafter we apply them we can't change their properties to modify the result we obtain. Modifiers let us apply modification\nto a mesh that is possible to revert, modify and preview. When we are sure about the result, we can apply the modifier\nto get the mesh modification we want.  \nWe can apply a modifier by selecting an object (right click on it) and go under the properties panel and *click on the\nwrench icon*. Here we can select a modifier from the list *Add modifier*.\n\n![The add modifier feature](../images/posts/blender-add-modifier.jpg)\n\nFor example let's try to add a simple deform to a cube. After adding it we see our cube deformed. We can than tweak the\nparameters of the deformation as we prefer. Each modifier as its own properties, based of which type of modification it\napplies to the mesh. Anyway there are some common button to:\n\n* *show/hide the modifier result during rendering*\n* *show/hide the modifier result in the 3D window*\n* *show/hide the modifier result in the 3D window in Edit mode*\n* *show/hide the cage of the modifier in the 3D window*\n\n![The add modifier panel](../images/posts/blender-add-modifier-icons.jpg)\n\nAfter that we have the **subdivision surface**. As stated on Wikipedia, subdivision surface is a technique discovered\nsimultaneously by Edwin Catmull and Jim Clark:\n\n> A subdivision surface, in the field of 3D computer graphics, is a method of representing a smooth surface via the specification of a coarser piecewise linear polygon mesh. The smooth surface can be calculated from the coarse mesh as the limit of recursive subdivision of each polygonal face into smaller faces that better approximate the smooth surface.\n\nThis basically means that with subdivision surface we can approximate smoother surfaces starting from another one.  \nIn Blender we can apply *subdivision surface as a modifier*.\n\n![The add subdivision surface feature](../images/posts/blender-add-subdivision-surface.jpg)\n\nAfter the subdivision is applied it is possible to modify the mesh only on the original edges and faces of the mesh. In\nfact this elements will be the only one that we can select from our mesh.\n\n![The result of adding subdivision surface to the mesh](../images/posts/blender-added-subdivision-surface.jpg)\n\nAnother interesting modifier is the **mirror modifier**. It is especially useful when you need to do Symmetric modeling.\nAfter applying this modifier every operation you made on one side of your mesh will be mirrored on the other side. For\nthis reason, especially when you're modeling some character/organic mesh, it is useful to delete one side of the mesh\nand mirror the other one (with all the modification you do). In the option of the modifier you can choose on which axis\nthe mirroring must be applied.\n\n![The mirror modifier](../images/posts/blender-mirror-modifier.jpg)\n\nThe last interesting modifier (for now) we will see it is the **boolean modifier**. This modifier let us modify meshes\nby calculate difference, union and intersection between them.\n\n![The boolean modifier](../images/posts/blender-boolean-modifier.jpg)\n\n![The boolean modifier options](../images/posts/blender-boolean-modifier-operation-option.jpg)\n\nAnother interesting tool is the **\"Loop Cut and Slide\"**. With this option we can add edge loops to our mesh. This tool\nis useful especially when you need to have more mesh polygon to model the mesh details you want.\n\n![The loop edge and slide tool](../images/posts/blender-loop-edge-and-slide.jpg)\n\nThen we have the **joining mesh tool** and the **stitching vertices tool**. For the first one, as the name suggest, you\ncan combine multiple mesh into a single one in blender. To join two or more meshes, we have to select them while we are\nobject mode. Remember: the last one selected will be the mesh to which the other ones will be joined. After that we can\napply the join mesh using:\n\n* *the menu option Object -> Join*\n* *the shortcut \"ctrl + j keys\"*\n\n![Join meshes tool](../images/posts/blender-join-meshes.jpg)\n\nAfter joining two or more meshes, we will need to fill the gap between then. We can do that by using the **merge tool**,\nthe **remove double tool** and the **snap element tool** to stitch the vertices that are on the border of the meshes.\nThe vertices must be open: they need to be without a connection on one side. So after selecting one vertex we can snap\nit using the snap element tool. We can activate it using the button in the bottom bar of the 3D window. After activating\nit we can grab the selected vertex by pressing the *g key*, and snap it to our target vertex.\n\n![Snap element tool](../images/posts/blender-snap-element.jpg)\n\nAfter snapping vertices we have to **remove duplicates**. We can do it using the merge tool or using the remove doubles\ntool. We can find these tools:\n\n* *under Mesh -> Type of element under selection*\n* from the contextual menu that you can show by using the shortcut *ctrl + v key* for vertices (NB.: there are also\n  contextual menus for faces and edges that we can show using *ctrl + f key* and *ctrl + e key*)\n\nIf we decide to go with the remove doubles tools, after applying the operation a popup at the top of the 3D window will\nappear that will tell us the number of duplicated vertices removed.\n\n![Merge remove tools](../images/posts/blender-merge-remove-tools.jpg)\n\nIn blender it is **possible to model also text**. We can add text by selecting *Add -> Text*. We can modify the text by\nselecting the edit mode: a text cursor will appear so that we can modify the text. In the property panel a special tab\nwill let as customize the text property.\n\n![Add text to a scene](../images/posts/blender-add-text.jpg)\n\n![Add text properties](../images/posts/blender-text-properties.jpg)\n\nLast but not least is the **vertex groups tool**. This tool allows us to save selection of vertices so that we are able\nto select them later. We can create a vertex group in the property panel in the corresponding tab. In this tab we have\nbuttons to:\n\n* *add/remove vertices to a group*\n* *select/deselect the vertices of a group*\n\n![The vertex group tool](../images/posts/blender-vertex-group.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will discuss about outliner, layers, groups, hierarchies and scenes.\n","slug":"/2018/08/21/blender-tutorial-5-advanced-modeling/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about advanced modeling in Blender.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"73bb15d3-a62f-5583-aeff-cef3112bd92d":{"title":"Blender tutorial: introduction to basics of modeling - part 1","content":"\n*In this new post of the Blender tutorial series I will talk about the fundamental of modeling in Blender.*\n\n---\n\nIn the [previous post of the \"Blender tutorial\" series](/2018/02/17/blender-tutorial-2-selecting-transforming-objects/ \"Blender tutorial: selecting and transforming objects\")\nwe talked about how we can select and transforms objects. In this new post thing will start to get more interesting: we\nwill start to talk about modeling. First of all let's see which kind of primitives mesh we can create with blender.  \nWe can start by opening a new file and **removing** the default cube mesh by selecting it and pressing the *\"x\" key*.\nNow we are ready to **add new primitive meshes**. We can do it in two ways:\n\n* from the *Tools -> Create* menu in the 3D window\n* from the *Add -> Mesh menu* at the bottom of the 3D window, when we are in object or edit mode\n\nBlender support a series of basic primitives, from which we can start modeling more complex meshes:\n\n* *plane*\n* *cube*\n* *circle*\n* *UV sphere*\n* *ico sphere*\n* *cylinder*\n* *cone*\n* *torus*\n\nWhen we choose a primitive mesh to be created, it will be placed where the 3D cursor is pointing at the moment of\ncreation. After the creation of the mesh, a new panel at the bottom left of the 3D window will be shown. In this panel\nwe can customize the properties of the mesh.\n\n![How to create primitive meshes](../images/posts/blender-modeling-create-primitive-meshes.jpg)\n\nAs we said before, we can start from a primitive mesh and model a more complex one. So the first thing we need to learn\nis how we can **select vertices, edges and faces**. How can we do that? First, we need to choose *edit mode*, by\nselecting the mesh and by choosing it from the editing/interaction mode menu component in the 3D window (or alternately\nby pressing the *\"tab\" key*). After that, we can choose the selection mode between vertices, edge or faces in the bottom\nbar of the 3D window or by pressing *\"ctrl + tab\" keys*.\n\n![How to select edges, faces and vertices](../images/posts/blender-select-edges-faces-vertices.jpg)\n\nAfter selecting the edges, vertices or faces that we want to modify, 3D axis will be shown near your selection. They are\nsimilar to the ones shown for transformations. By *dragging one of these axes* the selected vertices, edges or faces\nwill move accordingly to the direction of the dragging.  \nWe can improve the selection of edges by pressing *\"ctrl + alt + right click\" keys* while we are in edge selection mode:\nin this way we will be able to **select edges loops**, a series of connected closed edges series. We can also improve\nthe selection by using the more/less option to select entire levels of edges/vertices/faces.\n\n![How to modify a mesh](../images/posts/blender-modified-mesh.jpg)\n\nBy selecting individual edges, vertices and faces you can start modeling you meshes. Anyway, sometimes you will need to\nbe able to do a more soft modeling than the one we already described above in this article (for example while working on\norganic objects. This is why it is possible to use the *proportional editing*. When we use this kind of modeling, the\nmodification on a vertices/edge/face will influence the other element around with a proportional falloff. You can\nactivate the proportional editing using the menu *Mesh -> Proportional Editing* in *edit mode* or using the dedicated\nbutton in the bottom bar of the 3D window.\n\n![Proportional editing](../images/posts/blender-modeling-proportional-editing.jpg)\n\nBelow you can find an example of two meshes modified with and without the proportional editing enable. It's easy to see\nthe difference.\n\n![Two meshes modified with and without the proportional editing enable](../images/posts/blender-modeling-proportional-editing-example.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will continue to talk about the fundamental of modeling.\n","slug":"/2018/04/03/blender-tutorial-3-modeling-basics-part-1/","description":"In this new post of the Blender tutorial series I will talk about the fundamental of modeling in Blender.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"77732182-874d-583d-bee8-a0fb75fe8477":{"title":"React Native and Realm: custom manual link for an iOS app with custom directory structure","content":"\n*In this post I will show you how to install realm as a dependency in a React Native project with custom folders\nstructure without using react-native link command*.\n\n---\n\nWhat is React Native? It is one of the most successful and loved mobile development framework. It let you build *real\nnative mobile* application using Javascript. It has been developed by Facebook. Let's see the definition from the\nofficial website:\n\n> Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, you don't build a “mobile web app”, an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app”. You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.\n\nCool :sunglasses:!!!! Isn't it? Write an app using Javascript with the same performance of native code. You can also\nreuse your native component and bridge them to the javascript side.  \nMost of the time the React Native framework will help you also to manage dependencies inside you project. But sometimes,\nespecially if your project doesn't follow the standard React Native directories structure you can have some problem when\nyou try to link you external library.  \nWhile I was working on\nan [existing native app integrated with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps/ 'existing native app integrated with React Native')\nthat has a custom directories structure for the react-native and native code, I found some problem to\nadd [Realm](https://realm.io 'https://realm.io'), the famous open source dbms, as a dependency to the project.  \nIn this post I will show you an example of how you can add Realm to your app that has a custom React Native\ninstallation. Let's start :cold_sweat:!!\nTo describe the installation process I will use a sample app I created for this post called `ReactNativeRealmManualLink`\n. You can find it with realm installed\nin [this github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Realm-Manual-Link 'React Native realm manual link').  \nSuppose you have a project like the one I shared above, in which React Native is contained in a subfolder of the iOS\nproject, instead of the other way around in a standard React Native installation.\n\n![The folders structure of the project used as example in this post](../images/posts/react-native-realm-1-directories.jpg)\n\nFirst, to add realm as a dependency we need to install it through npm with following command.\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save realm\n```\n\nThen we try to link the library to the native code with the standard React Native command.\n\n```shell\nreact-native link realm\n```\n\nBut here something strange happens: as you can see from the screenshot below the command fails to link the library. So\nwe need to find another way to install the library.\n\n![The react-native link command fails to install the realm library](../images/posts/react-native-realm-2-link-fails.jpg)\n\nUsually, if the previous command fails, you have to do\nthe [manual linking](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking-libraries-ios/ \"manual linking\"). To do it we navigate inside\nthe `node_modules` folder, contained in the React Native folder of our project, to found the realm folder. Inside it you\nwill find an Xcode project named `RealmReact`, that you have to drag into our project. After that we have to add a\nreference to the static library `libRealmReact` and compile the project.\n\n![Add the ReactRealm xcodeproj to the project](../images/posts/react-native-realm-3-manual-link-step-1.jpg)\n![Link the Realm static lib](../images/posts/react-native-realm-3-manual-link-step-2.jpg)\n\nNow you would expect that everything works fine but...\n\n![The compilation fails with a complain about a header file missing](../images/posts/react-native-realm-4-manual-link-fails.jpg)\n\nWhat's happening? The `RealmReact` project is expecting the React Native headers in a relative position with respect to\nits original position. Argh :rage:!! We need to find another way...\n\nWhat can we do? We can start by observing that the `RealmReact` project is just a \"container project\" for:\n\n* `RealmJS` project, that generates two static libraries `libRealmJS.a` and `libGCDWebServers.a`\n* an Objective-C++ class `RealmReact`\n* an Objective-C++ file `RealmAnalytics`\n\nSo we can try to modify our main project by:\n\n* adding the `RealmJS` project and the Objective-C++ files/classes as references\n* linking the static libraries `libRealmJS.a` and `libGCDWebServers.a` to our main project and see if everything works\n\n![Add the RealmReact folder and the RealmJS xcodeproj to the project](../images/posts/react-native-realm-5-custom-manual-link-step-1.jpg)\n\n![Add libRealmJS and libGCDWebServers static libraries to the project](../images/posts/react-native-realm-5-custom-manual-link-step-2.jpg)\n\nNow we need to add to the `Header search path` option of our main project the paths that were set in the `RealmReact`\nproject. In this way the `RealmJS` project will be able to find some headers it needs. You can find the complete list of\nthe folder that we need to add in the screenshot below.\n\n![Add the header search paths that were setted in the RealmReact project](../images/posts/react-native-realm-6-header-search-path.jpg)\n\nNow if we try to compile our app we expect that everything works fine but...ERROR :warning::fire:!!! The build fails :\nboom:!!!\n\n![The C++ compiler gives an error when compiling the RealmReact source code](../images/posts/react-native-realm-7-Cplusplus-error.jpg)\n\nIt seems like that in order to be able to compile the C++ source code contained in `RealmJS` we need to set a recent C++\nversion in our project setting that supports some new features like auto return type on static function. We can set it\nto C++ 14 and set the Standard Library to the LLVM one with C++ 11 support.\n\n![Update the C++ language dialect and std library to C++14/11](../images/posts/react-native-realm-8-Cplusplus-setup.jpg)\n\nOne final step is to remove the flag `-all_load` from the `Other linker flag` option of the main project (if you have\nit). In this way we avoid to load all Objective-C symbols and have the \"duplicated symbols\" error.\n\n![Remove the all_load linker flag](../images/posts/react-native-realm-9-all_load.jpg)\n\nWe are now ready to build our app and see if everything works. To do this we create a sample native view controller that\nhas a `RCTRootView`.\n\n```swift\nclass ReactNativeRealmController: UIViewController {\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        let jsCodeLocation = URL(string: \"http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios\")\n        view = RCTRootView(\n            bundleURL: jsCodeLocation,\n            moduleName: \"ReactNativeRealmScreen\",\n            initialProperties: nil,\n            launchOptions: nil\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand a sample react component with some realm write/read operations.\n\n```jsx\nconst Realm = require('realm');\n\nclass ReactNativeRealmScreen extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      realm: null\n    };\n  }\n\n  componentWillMount() {\n    Realm.open({\n      schema: [{ name: 'Band', properties: { name: 'string', singer: 'string' } }]\n    }).then(realm => {\n      realm.write(() => {\n        realm.create('Band', { name: 'HIM', singer: 'Ville Valo' });\n      });\n      this.setState({ realm });\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const message = this.state.realm\n      ? 'The singer of HIM band is: ' + this.state.realm.objects('Band').filtered('name = \"HIM\"')[0].singer\n      : 'Loading...';\n\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text>\n          {message}\n        </Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',\n  }\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('ReactNativeRealmScreen', () => ReactNativeRealmScreen, false);\n```\n\nWe are now ready to build our app and, as expected, everything works fine.\n\n![The example app compilation is working as expected and you can try to launch it](../images/posts/react-native-realm-10-build-works.jpg)\n\nThat's it!! As I told you before you can find the complete example\nin [this github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Realm-Manual-Link 'React Native realm manual link'). We are\nnow ready to create our React Native component with realm :bowtie:.  \n","slug":"/2017/11/14/react-native-realm-custom-manual-linking-app-custom-directories-ios/","description":"In this post I will show you how to install realm as a dependency in a React Native project with custom folders structure without using react-native link command.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"785708b7-3276-5ba2-ab6e-7bef03775bba":{"title":"Rich iOS notifications with Notification Content App Extension","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about iOS notification customization with Notification Content App Extension.*\n\n---\n\nDuring a workshop I recently attended I had the opportunity to explore a new interesting app extension type available in\nthe iOS SDK: Notification Content App Extension. This extension has been added by Apple in iOS 10. By using this\nextension it is possible to customize the UI of your push and local notification. In this way you can show more engaging\nnotification to your users :grin:.  \nLet's see an example where we create a notification with custom UI using this extension type. To do that I will use some\nassets taken from the [nasa photo journal](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/ \"nasa photo journal\"). You can find the\ncomplete example [in this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Notification-Content-Extension-Example \"notification content extension example\"). \nLet's start from the beginning: add a Notification Content Extension to your app. To do that just select the + button\nin the target section that appears after selecting the xcodeproj file.\n\n![Add a new Notification Content Extension target to the app](../images/posts/notification-content-extension-add-target.jpg)\n\nThe extension that is created contains a `NotificationViewController` that adheres to\nthe `UNNotificationContentExtension`. The documentation for this protocol says:\n\n> An object that presents a custom interface for a delivered local or remote notification. The UNNotificationContentExtension protocol provides the entry point for a notification content app extension, which displays a custom interface for your app’s notifications. You adopt this protocol in the custom UIViewController subclass that you use to present your interface. You create this type of extension to improve the way your notifications are presented, possibly by adding custom colors and branding, or by incorporating media and other dynamic content into your notification interface.\n\nSo if a `UIViewController` inside a Notification Content Extension adhere to the `UNNotificationContentExtension` we are\nable to access to the notification content and we can customize its UI. In the extension there's also\na `MainInterface.storyboard` that contains a single controller associated with the `NotificationViewController`\npreviously mentioned. We can use this storyboard to customize the notification UI using interface builder. So let's\nstart by defining the interface in the storyboard. Below in the image there's the final result.\n\n![Customize the notification UI with the storyboard contained in the new created extension](../images/posts/notification-content-extension-storyboard-notification.jpg)\n\nThen we can fill the UI with the notification content we receive in\nthe `func didReceive(_ notification: UNNotification)` of the `NotificationViewController` controller that implements the\nprotocol shown above. Below you can find its source code.\n\n```swift\nimport UserNotifications\nimport UserNotificationsUI\n\nclass NotificationViewController: UIViewController, UNNotificationContentExtension {\n    @IBOutlet weak var nasaImage: UIImageView!\n    @IBOutlet weak var nasaTitle: UILabel!\n    @IBOutlet weak var nasaDescription: UILabel!\n\n    func didReceive(_ notification: UNNotification) {\n        if let validTitle = notification.request.content.userInfo[\"title\"] as? String,\n            let validDescription = notification.request.content.userInfo[\"description\"] as? String,\n            let validImageName = notification.request.content.userInfo[\"imageName\"] as? String {\n            nasaTitle.text = validTitle\n            nasaDescription.text = validDescription\n            nasaImage.image = UIImage(named: validImageName)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow to test our controller and our new notification UI, we can create a local notification. We will use some data taken\nfrom the nasa photo journal. We will create a `NasaLocalNotificationBuilder` that contains all the notification creation\nlogic. This is the final result.\n\n```swift\nimport UserNotifications\n\nclass NasaLocalNotificationBuilder {\n    private let notificationCenter: UNUserNotificationCenter = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()\n    private var notificationActions: [UNNotificationAction] = []\n    private var notificationContent = UNMutableNotificationContent()\n\n    func setActions() -> NasaLocalNotificationBuilder {\n        notificationActions.append(\n            UNNotificationAction(identifier: \"view\",\n                                 title: \"View Photo in app\",\n                                 options: [.foreground, .authenticationRequired])\n        )\n        notificationActions.append(\n            UNNotificationAction(identifier: \"skip\",\n                                 title: \"Skip\",\n                                 options: [])\n        )\n        return self\n    }\n\n    func setCategory() -> NasaLocalNotificationBuilder {\n        let notificationCategory = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: \"NasaDailyPhoto\",\n                                                          actions: notificationActions,\n                                                          intentIdentifiers: [],\n                                                          hiddenPreviewsBodyPlaceholder: \"\",\n                                                          options: .customDismissAction)\n        notificationCenter.setNotificationCategories([notificationCategory])\n        return self\n    }\n\n    func setContent() -> NasaLocalNotificationBuilder {\n        notificationContent.title = \"Your Nasa Daily Photo\"\n        notificationContent.body = \"Long press to see you daily nasa photo\"\n        notificationContent.sound = UNNotificationSound.default()\n        notificationContent.categoryIdentifier = \"NasaDailyPhoto\"\n        notificationContent.userInfo = [\n            \"title\" : \"At the Heart of Orion\",\n            \"description\" : \"\"\"\n            Near the center of this sharp cosmic portrait, at the heart of the Orion Nebula, are four hot, massive\n            stars known as the Trapezium. Gathered within a region about 1.5 light-years in radius, they dominate the\n            core of the dense Orion Nebula Star Cluster. Ultraviolet ionizing radiation from the Trapezium stars,\n            mostly from the brightest star Theta-1 Orionis C powers the complex star forming region's entire visible\n            glow. About three million years old, the Orion Nebula Cluster was even more compact in its younger years\n            and a recent dynamical study indicates that runaway stellar collisions at an earlier age may have formed\n            a black hole with more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. The presence of a black hole within the cluster\n            could explain the observed high velocities of the Trapezium stars. The Orion Nebula's distance of some\n            1,500 light-years would make it the closest known black hole to planet Earth.\n            \"\"\",\n            \"imageName\" : \"orion\"\n        ]\n        return self\n    }\n\n    func build() {\n        let trigger = UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 5, repeats: false)\n        let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: \"NasaDailyPhoto\",\n                                            content: notificationContent,\n                                            trigger: trigger)\n        notificationCenter.add(request, withCompletionHandler: nil)\n    }\n}\n```  \n\nThen we can call the notification builder in the main controller of the app `ViewController` to generate the\nnotification.\n\n```swift\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        NasaLocalNotificationBuilder()\n            .setActions()\n            .setCategory()\n            .setContent()\n            .build()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we have to go back in our notification content extension and set some attribute in its `info.plist`. In particular\nwe have to set:\n\n* `UNNotificationExtensionCategory` to the notification category that we want to customize. In our case we\n  use `NasaDailyPhoto`, the value we previously set in the builder\n* `UNNotificationExtensionDefaultContentHidden` to hide the standard notification content when the user long press the\n  notification.\n* if needed it is possible also to set the `UNNotificationExtensionInitialContentSizeRatio` to a value different from 1\n  to customize the aspect ratio of our notification.\n\nWe're ready to test our implementation. Below you can find a video with the final result of our implementation.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pDTklC4ocY`\n\nThat's all for Notification Content App Extension on iOS.

This time I will talk about *Data structures\nand objects*. But wait, do we really know the definition of them? Let's see\nwhat [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin \"Robert Cecil Martin\") says about them in its *Clean\nCode* book:\n\n> Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.\n\nIt's easy to see that they are opposites. A lot of programmers are convinced of the fact that in software development\neverything should be an object. If you think about the nature of objects you will see that *there are times where you\njust want simple plain data structures that you can manipulate in a procedural way*. This is a consequence of the fact\nthat adding new functions to an object may require much more work, because maybe you need to modify all the objects of\nthe same type to add a new function. This give us the following definitions, stated\nby [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin\n\"Robert Cecil Martin\") in its *Clean Code* book:\n\n> Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures. Object oriented code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions.  \nProcedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. Object oriented code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.\n\nThis set of rules must guide us when we have to choose between objects vs procedural implementation:\n\n* do you expect to add more and more functions to your code, and keep unmodified the data structures you use? Ok, let's\n  go with procedural code :relaxed:.\n* do you expect to add new types without adding new functions to your code? Well, use objects :bowtie:.\n\nRelated to the object oriented programming, Uncle Bob talks about the **law of demeter** that says a\n**module should not know about innards of the objects it manipulates**. The focus of this law is to improve the\ndecoupling of objects. More precisely its definition is:\n\n> A method *f* of a class *C* should only call the methods of these:\n>\n> * *C*\n> * an object created by *f*\n> * an object passed as argument to *f*\n> * an object held in a instance variable of *C*\n\nThis bring us to talk about what is called *train wreck*: concatenation of function/properties calls. The difference\nbetween objects and data structures gives us a clear understand of when a train wreck is really dangerous:\n\n* **if in a method you're working with data structures, law of demeter is not applied to them because is natural for a\n  data structure to expose their internal structure.**\n* **if in a method you're working with objects, then you should consider concatenation of method calls as violation of\n  the law of demeter**\n\nThe next time you will write a piece of code try to consider these concepts and how they can improve your code.\n\n![Uncle bob, the superman of clean code](../images/posts/uncle-bob-defender-of-clean-code.jpg)\n","slug":"/2018/04/25/clean-code-objects-data-structures-law-demeter/","description":"In this post I will talk about clean code: data structures, objects vs procedural and the law of demeter.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"79ffba6f-1169-5c0e-8e2a-99df5d77dc42":{"title":"Model View Presenter on iOS: no more excuses, write your unit test","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about the model view presenter architectural pattern and how it can improve you unit test and\nyour TDD workflow when developing an iOS application.*\n\n---\n\nUnit test in iOS application is in some way \"hard\". The architectural pattern implemented by default on iOS is\nthe [Model View Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller \"Model View Controller\"). This\narchitecture provides you a clear separation between the UI and the business logic. The problem is that most of the time\nyou have to fight with \"Massive View Controllers\" that act as glue between the model and a lot of UI/view code and that,\nfor this reason, are not so easy to test. This basically means that most of the time\nthe [presentation logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_logic \"presentation logic\"), how the business model\nis displayed to the user in the User Interface, is tested in the wrong way, or maybe worst it is not tested.  \nThis is were the [Model View Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter \"Model view presenter\") could\nsave us. In this architectural pattern all the *presentation logic is moved from the view controller to a new component,\nthe presenter*. This means that it will manage *model objects* to retrieve the data and then prepare it to be displayed\nby the *view, that will be our View Controller*. This one becomes a passive interface that has the only responsibility\nto show data returned by the presenter in the specific platform User Interface component. In this way the presenter is a\ncomponent without any platform specific dependency, that works only on the view and other model objects, injected at\nconstruction time. In this way all dependencies could be mocked and you can unit test basically everything!! :relaxed:  \nNow it's time to see the Model View Presenter in action!! :grin: We will create a simple app that shows a list on\nproducts in a `UITableView`. On the tap of a cell the product detail is shown. An error will be displayed if an error\noccurs when the products are retrieved or when it doesn't contain all the data needed to show its detail. We will\ndevelop this app\nusing [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development \"Test Driven Development\")\ntechnique, and I will show the unit tests created for each class implemented. These unit tests will also be written\nusing the [\"Given-then-when\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given-When-Then \"Given-then-when\") structure, typically used\nin [Behaviour Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development \"Behaviour Driven Development\")\n. Even if not related to this article, I like this way of writing unit tests because they are more expressive, so I will\nuse it in all my code. Below you can find a mockup of what we want to achieve.\n\n![A mockup of the final app we will obtain at the end of this post](../images/posts/mockup-model-view-presenter.jpg\")\n\nLet's start by creating a `Product` struct that we will use to describe our products. Each product will be composed of a\nname, a description and an image (identified by its name):\n\n```swift\npublic struct Product {\n    let name: String\n    let description: String\n    let image: String\n\n    public init(name: String, description: String, image: String) {\n        self.name = name\n        self.description = description\n        self.image = image\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe products objects will be retrieved using\na [Repository](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html \"Repository\"). First of all we need to define\na `Repository` protocol. Generally speaking, we will try to define a protocol for all our classes so that we can work\nusing abstraction (and not concrete implementation) to obtain the highest decoupling between our classes. Last but not\nleast (and maybe the most important thing) by using protocols we will be able to produce some mocks/spies of our\ncomponents in our unit tests.\n\n```swift\npublic protocol Repository {\n    func get(finish: @escaping ([Product]?) -> Void)\n}\n```\n\nIn our case the repository will not retrieve the data from a real datasource or using a service. All data will be\nretrieved from a local array inside the repository. This is the final implementation of our repository:\n\n```swift\npublic class ProductsRepository: Repository {\n\n    public func get(finish: @escaping ([Product]?) -> Void) {\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + .milliseconds(3000)) {\n            let products = [\n                Product(name: \"Car\", description: \"A beautiful car\", image: \"car\"),\n                Product(name: \"Book\", description: \"\", image: \"book\")\n            ]\n            finish(products)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEven if out of our scope, below you can find the unit tests for our `ProductsRepository`. They are interesting because\nyou can find an example of unit test with expectation (another thing to be discussed sooner or later :\nstuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).\n\n```swift\nclass ProductsRepositoryTests: XCTestCase {\n    private var productsRepository: ProductsRepository!\n\n    func testProductsRetrieved() {\n        givenAProductsRepository()\n        whenTheRepositoryTryToRetrieveProducts { [unowned self] products, repositoryExpectation in\n            self.thenTheProductsListIsRetrieved(products: products,\n                                                expectation: repositoryExpectation)\n        }\n        thenTheRepositoryFinishedToTryToRetrieve()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductsRepository() {\n        productsRepository = ProductsRepository()\n    }\n\n    func whenTheRepositoryTryToRetrieveProducts(finish: @escaping ([Product]?, XCTestExpectation) -> Void) {\n        let repositoryExpectation = expectation(description: \"RepositoryExpectation\")\n        productsRepository.get { products in\n            finish(products, repositoryExpectation)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductsListIsRetrieved(products: [Product]?, expectation: XCTestExpectation) {\n        XCTAssertNotNil(products)\n        XCTAssertTrue(products!.count > 0)\n        expectation.fulfill()\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheRepositoryFinishedToTryToRetrieve() {\n        waitForExpectations(timeout: 10) { error in\n            if let error = error {\n                XCTFail(\"Repository finish() not called: \\(error)\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow it's time to develop our `ProductsPresenter` presenter. It will need a view to which it will delegate the real user\ninterface operation and the Repository to retrieve the products data. It will be responsible to manage:\n\n* **the start of the view in the** `onStart()` method. In this method we will have to update the view to show a loading\n  status (that will be a `UIActivityIndicator` in the view implementation), then try to retrieve the products from the\n  repository and show them on the view if everything goes fine. If something goes wrong show on the view an error\n  message. In any case, it also need to hide the loading status after the retrieve operation has been completed.\n* **the show detail action in the** `onSelected(product: Product)` method. In this method we will have to check if all\n  the product data is correct, that in our case means that the product must have a valid product. If it is valid, show\n  its detail in the view, else an error message.\n\nWe start by defining the protocol `ProductView`, that contains all the valid operation of the view that our presenter\nwill use:\n\n```swift\npublic protocol ProductsView: class {\n    func showLoadingStatus()\n    func hideLoadingStatus()\n    func show(title aTitle: String)\n    func show(products: [Product])\n    func showErrorWith(message: String)\n    func showDetailFor(product: Product)\n}\n```\n\nNow we are ready to proceed with the `ProductsPresenter` implementation:\n\n```swift\npublic class ProductsPresenter {\n    private unowned let productsView: ProductsView\n    private let productsRepository: Repository\n\n    public init(productsView: ProductsView, productsRepository: Repository) {\n        self.productsView = productsView\n        self.productsRepository = productsRepository\n    }\n\n    public func onStart() {\n        productsView.show(title: \"Products\")\n        productsView.showLoadingStatus()\n        productsRepository.get { [unowned self] retrievedProducts in\n            self.tryToShow(retrievedProducts: retrievedProducts)\n            self.productsView.hideLoadingStatus()\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func tryToShow(retrievedProducts: [Product]?) {\n        if let products = retrievedProducts {\n            productsView.show(products: products)\n        } else {\n            productsView.showErrorWith(message: \"No products available\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    public func onSelected(product: Product) {\n        if product.description != \"\" {\n            productsView.showDetailFor(product: product)\n        } else {\n            productsView.showErrorWith(message: \"Product without description\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDevelop a class like this one in TDD it's easy, given the fact that we can mock every dependencies it has and we can\ntest in detail all the presentation flow. The unit test of our presenter are shown below. *You can note that a lot of\nhandcraft made mock objects are used but not reported here (you will find them in the complete project on Github\nreported at the end of this article)*.\n\n```swift\nclass ProductsPresenterTests: XCTestCase {\n    private var productsRepositoryWithProducts: ProductsRepositoryWithProductsSpy!\n    private var productsRepositoryWithoutProducts: ProductsRepositoryWithoutProductsSpy!\n    private var productsView: ProductsViewSpy!\n    private var productPresenter: ProductsPresenter!\n\n    func testOnStartWithProducts() {\n        givenAProductsRepositoryWithProducts()\n        givenAProductsView()\n        givenAProductsPresenterWith(repository: productsRepositoryWithProducts)\n        whenTheProductsPresenterStarts()\n        thenTheTitleIsDisplayed()\n        thenTheProductViewShowsLoadingStatus()\n        thenTryToRetrieveProduct()\n        thenTheProductViewHidesLoadingStatus()\n        thenTheProductsViewShowsTheProducts()\n    }\n\n    func testOnStartWithoutProducts() {\n        givenAProductsRepositoryWithoutProducts()\n        givenAProductsView()\n        givenAProductsPresenterWith(repository: productsRepositoryWithoutProducts)\n        whenTheProductsPresenterStarts()\n        thenTheTitleIsDisplayed()\n        thenTheProductViewShowsLoadingStatus()\n        thenTryToRetrieveProductFromEmptyRepository()\n        thenTheProductViewHidesLoadingStatus()\n        thenTheProductsViewShowsAnErrorMessage()\n    }\n\n    func testOnProductWithDescriptionSelected() {\n        givenAProductsRepositoryWithProducts()\n        givenAProductsView()\n        givenAProductsPresenterWith(repository: productsRepositoryWithProducts)\n        whenAProductWithDescriptionIsSelected()\n        thenTheProductDetailIsShown()\n    }\n\n    func testOnProductWithoutDescriptionSelected() {\n        givenAProductsRepositoryWithProducts()\n        givenAProductsView()\n        givenAProductsPresenterWith(repository: productsRepositoryWithProducts)\n        whenAProductWithoutDescriptionIsSelected()\n        thenTheProductsViewShowsAnErrorMessage()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductsRepositoryWithProducts() {\n        productsRepositoryWithProducts = ProductsRepositoryWithProductsSpy()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductsRepositoryWithoutProducts() {\n        productsRepositoryWithoutProducts = ProductsRepositoryWithoutProductsSpy()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductsView() {\n        productsView = ProductsViewSpy()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductsPresenterWith(repository: Repository) {\n        productPresenter = ProductsPresenter(productsView: productsView, productsRepository: repository)\n    }\n\n    private func whenTheProductsPresenterStarts() {\n        productPresenter.onStart()\n    }\n\n    func whenAProductWithDescriptionIsSelected() {\n        productPresenter.onSelected(product: Product(name: \"Car\",\n                                                     description: \"A beautiful car\",\n                                                     image: \"car\"))\n    }\n\n    func whenAProductWithoutDescriptionIsSelected() {\n        productPresenter.onSelected(product: Product(name: \"Car\",\n                                                     description: \"\",\n                                                     image: \"car\"))\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheTitleIsDisplayed() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsView.showTitleHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTryToRetrieveProduct() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsRepositoryWithProducts.getHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductViewShowsLoadingStatus() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsView.showLoadingStatusHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductViewHidesLoadingStatus() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsView.hideLoadingStatusHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductsViewShowsTheProducts() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsView.showProductsHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTryToRetrieveProductFromEmptyRepository() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsRepositoryWithoutProducts.getHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductsViewShowsAnErrorMessage() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsView.showsErrorMessageHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductDetailIsShown() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productsView.showDetailForProductHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt easy to see that the unit tests for our presenter describe the entire presentation flow. This basically means that\nour unit tests are the documentation of our presentation logic. Cool!!!! :sunglasses:\nNow the next big question is: who is going to implement our `ProductsView` protocol? As we said in the introduction, our\nview controllers become the View in the Model View Presenter architecture. They act as passive platform specific user\ninterface components updater. This means that our protocol will be implemented by `ProductsViewController`. It have the\nresponsibility to launch the `ProductsPresenter` action at the right time and implement all the real passive User\nInterface update operation. In particular we will have our `onStart()` presenter method call in the `viewDidLoad` and\nthe `onSelected(product: Product)` when a product cell is tapped, that means a product has been selected. The final\nimplementation will be:\n\n```swift\nclass ProductsViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate, ProductsView {\n    @IBOutlet weak var productsTableView: UITableView!\n    @IBOutlet weak var productsLoadingView: UIView!\n    @IBOutlet weak var productsActivityIndicator: UIActivityIndicatorView!\n    private var productsList: [Product]!\n    private var productSelected: Product!\n    private var productsRepository: ProductsRepository!\n    private var productsPresenter: ProductsPresenter!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        initializeDependencies()\n        productsPresenter.onStart()\n    }\n\n    private func initializeDependencies() {\n        productsList = []\n        productsRepository = ProductsRepository()\n        productsPresenter = ProductsPresenter(productsView: self, productsRepository: productsRepository)\n    }\n\n    //MARK: ProductsView\n\n    public func show(title aTitle: String) {\n        title = aTitle\n    }\n\n    public func showLoadingStatus() {\n        productsActivityIndicator.startAnimating()\n        productsLoadingView.isHidden = false\n    }\n\n    public func hideLoadingStatus() {\n        productsActivityIndicator.stopAnimating()\n        productsLoadingView.isHidden = true\n    }\n\n    public func show(products: [Product]) {\n        productsList = products\n        productsTableView.reloadData()\n    }\n\n    public func showErrorWith(message: String) {\n        let alert = UIAlertController(title: \"Error\", message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)\n        alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: \"Ok\", style: .default, handler: { [unowned self] action in\n            self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)\n        }))\n        present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)\n    }\n\n    public func showDetailFor(product: Product) {\n        productSelected = product\n        performSegue(withIdentifier: \"ShowProductDetail\", sender: nil)\n    }\n\n    //MARK: Segue\n\n    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {\n        if let productDetailViewController = segue.destination as? ProductDetailViewController {\n            productDetailViewController.product = productSelected\n        }\n    }\n\n    //MARK: UITableView Datasource\n\n    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {\n        return productsList.count\n    }\n\n    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {\n        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"ProductCell\", for: indexPath)\n        cell.textLabel?.text = productsList[indexPath.row].name\n        return cell\n    }\n\n    //MARK: UITableView Delegate\n\n    public func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\n        productsPresenter.onSelected(product: productsList[indexPath.row])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou don't need unit tests for the controller: the presenter unit tests assure that our presentation logic is the one\nexpected. The view controller is only updating iOS specific User Interface components (something we hope Apple tested\nfor us :smirk:). In the same way we developed this components, we can go on and implement our product detail by defining\nfirst of all a `ProductDetailView`:\n\n```swift\npublic protocol ProductDetailView: class {\n    func show(title aTitle: String)\n    func show(product: Product)\n    func showErrorWith(message: String)\n}\n```\n\nThen our `ProductDetailPresenter` presenter, that will be responsible to check that a valid product to show has been\nreceived:\n\n```swift\npublic class ProductDetailPresenter {\n    private unowned let productDetailView: ProductDetailView\n    private let product: Product?\n\n    public init(productDetailView: ProductDetailView, product: Product?) {\n        self.productDetailView = productDetailView\n        self.product = product\n    }\n\n    public func onStart() {\n        productDetailView.show(title: \"Product\")\n        if let product = product {\n            productDetailView.show(product: product)\n        } else {\n            productDetailView.showErrorWith(message: \"Product not valid\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIts unit tests will be:\n\n```swift\nclass ProductDetailPresenterTests: XCTestCase {\n    private var productDetailPresenter: ProductDetailPresenter!\n    private var productDetailView: ProductDetailViewSpy!\n\n    func testShowDetailOfAProduct() {\n        givenAProductDetailView()\n        givenAProductDetailPresenterWith(product: Product(name: \"aProduct\",\n                                                          description: \"aDescription\",\n                                                          image: \"image\"))\n        whenThePresenterStarts()\n        thenTheTitleIsDisplayed()\n        thenTheProductDetailIsShown()\n    }\n\n    func testShowDetailOfAnInvalidProduct() {\n        givenAProductDetailView()\n        givenAProductDetailPresenterWith(product: nil)\n        whenThePresenterStarts()\n        thenTheTitleIsDisplayed()\n        thenAnErrorMessageIsDisplayed()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductDetailView() {\n        productDetailView = ProductDetailViewSpy()\n    }\n\n    private func givenAProductDetailPresenterWith(product: Product?) {\n        productDetailPresenter = ProductDetailPresenter(productDetailView: productDetailView, product: product)\n    }\n\n    private func whenThePresenterStarts() {\n        productDetailPresenter.onStart()\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheTitleIsDisplayed() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productDetailView.showTitleHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenTheProductDetailIsShown() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productDetailView.showProductHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    private func thenAnErrorMessageIsDisplayed() {\n        XCTAssertTrue(productDetailView.showErrorHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n}\n\n....\n\nclass ProductDetailViewSpy: ProductDetailView {\n    private(set) var showTitleHasBeenCalled: Bool = false\n    private(set) var showProductHasBeenCalled: Bool = false\n    private(set) var showErrorHasBeenCalled: Bool = false\n\n    func show(title aTitle: String) {\n        showTitleHasBeenCalled = true\n    }\n\n    func show(product: Product) {\n        showProductHasBeenCalled = true\n    }\n\n    func showErrorWith(message: String) {\n        showErrorHasBeenCalled = true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally our `ProductDetailViewController` that is the view controller for this app section:\n\n```swift\nclass ProductDetailViewController: UIViewController, ProductDetailView {\n    @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!\n    @IBOutlet weak var descriptionLabel: UILabel!\n    @IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!\n    var product: Product!\n    private var productDetailPresenter: ProductDetailPresenter!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        initializeDependencies()\n        productDetailPresenter.onStart()\n    }\n\n    private func initializeDependencies() {\n        productDetailPresenter = ProductDetailPresenter(productDetailView: self, product: product)\n    }\n\n    //MARK: ProductDetailView\n\n    public func show(title aTitle: String) {\n        title = aTitle\n    }\n\n    public func show(product: Product) {\n        nameLabel.text = product.name\n        descriptionLabel.text = product.description\n        imageView.image = UIImage(named: product.image)\n    }\n\n    public func showErrorWith(message: String) {\n        let alert = UIAlertController(title: \"Error\", message: message, preferredStyle: .alert)\n        alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: \"Ok\", style: .default, handler: { [unowned self] action in\n            self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)\n        }))\n        present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYeah you made it!! You're at the end of this never ending post :satisfied:!!  \nNow you can start to create your high quality unit tested apps :relieved:. One final note about the implementation\nabove: **the `productsView` property of the `ProductsPresenter` and `productDetailView` of the `ProductDetailPresenter`\nmust be `unowned` or `weak` to avoid a retain cycle between the presenters and the controllers.**\n\n![model view presenter: let's toast to Unit Tests!](../images/posts/model-view-presenter-ios.jpg)\n\nTime to try it yourself in one of your project. If you wanna review the complete project code you can\ncheck [this Github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Model-View-Presenter \"Model View Presenter iOS github repository\")\n.\n","slug":"/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/","description":"In this post I will talk about the model view presenter architectural pattern and how it can improve you unit test and your TDD workflow when developing an iOS application.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"7aff838a-810d-5852-aeed-497b0b6c2212":{"title":"SceneKit and physically based rendering","content":"\n*In this post I will guide you in the creation of a scene using SceneKit and its physically based rendering features.*\n\n---\n\nSceneKit is one of the framework inside the iOS SDK that I love the most. What is SceneKit? Let's see the definition\nfrom the developer apple website:\n\n> SceneKit combines a high-performance rendering engine with a descriptive API for import, manipulation, and rendering of 3D assets. Unlike lower-level APIs such as Metal and OpenGL that require you to implement in precise detail the rendering algorithms that display a scene, SceneKit requires only descriptions of your scene’s contents and the actions or animations you want it to perform.\n\nAs you can see from the definition there's a lot of stuff inside it. Basically by using SceneKit you will be able to\ncreate games and other 3D applications without the need to know any computer graphics algorithms, physics simulations\nstuff and so on. You basically describe a Scene in terms of objects and features and Apple will do everything for you :\nsunglasses:.  \nOne of the most interesting thing about SceneKit on the computer graphics side has been introduced in 2016: physically\nbased rendering (PBR).  \nWe've already seen what PBR is\nin [a previous post](/2017/12/07/physically-base-rendering-introduction/ \"physically based rendering introduction post\")\n, so you already know its theoretical foundation stuff (or go to check it out in case you missed it :wink:). So that\nmeans that SceneKit could render physically based scene using its own entirely new physically based rendering engine. Is\nit worth it? Sure!! :blush:  So, let's try it!\nIn this post we will create a scene from scratch that uses the main PBR features you can find inside SceneKit. At the\nend of this post you will be able to render the scene contained in the image below. So it's time to start coding!!\n\n![A physically based scene created using SceneKit](../images/posts/physically-based-rendering-scene-right.jpg)\n\nThe general approach used in the construction of the scene will be the following: for each main scene category component\nwe will create a class that encapsulate the creation of the corresponding `SCNNode`, the base SceneKit unit element, and\nits setup to obtain the feature we want.  \nThe first class we are going to create is the `Light` class that encapsulate the base features we need to set up the\nlight: position, rotation and generic color. Light in SceneKit are represented using the `SCNLight` class.\n\n```swift\nclass Light {\n    let node: SCNNode\n\n    init(lightNode: SCNNode) {\n        node = lightNode\n    }\n\n    init(lightFeatures: LightFeatures) {\n        node = SCNNode()\n        createLight()\n        set(lightFeatures: lightFeatures)\n    }\n\n    func createLight() {\n        node.light = SCNLight()\n    }\n\n    private func set(lightFeatures: LightFeatures) {\n        node.light?.color = lightFeatures.color\n        node.position = lightFeatures.position\n        node.eulerAngles = lightFeatures.orientation;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe basic features of the light must be passed at construction time using a `LightFeatures` objects.\n\n```swift\nclass LightFeatures {\n    let position: SCNVector3\n    let orientation: SCNVector3\n    let color: UIColor\n\n    init(position: SCNVector3, orientation: SCNVector3, color: UIColor) {\n        self.position = position\n        self.orientation = orientation\n        self.color = color\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe are now ready to create our `PhysicallyBasedLight` as an child of `Light` class. Our physically based light will be\nof type `.directional`, and we will customize its `intensity` and `temperature`. The intensity is the flux of the\nlight (again, go to\ncheck [my first post about physically based rendering](/2017/12/07/physically-base-rendering-introduction/ \n\"physically based introduction post\")\nif you don't know what it is :stuck_out_tongue:), and the second one is the color temperature expressed in Kelvin (\nremember: 6500 K corresponds to pure white sunlight). We activate other interesting features: by setting `castsShadow`\nto `true` we activate the rendering of shadow using shadow mapping technique, and by setting `orthographicScale` to `10`\nwe extend a little bit the visible area of the scene from the light, so we are improving the construction of the shadow\nmap.\n\n```swift\nclass PhysicallyBasedLight: Light {\n\n    init(lightFeatures: LightFeatures, physicallyBasedLightFeatures: PhysicallyBasedLightFeatures) {\n        super.init(lightFeatures: lightFeatures)\n        set(physicallyBasedLightFeatures: physicallyBasedLightFeatures)\n        activateShadow()\n    }\n\n    private func set(physicallyBasedLightFeatures: PhysicallyBasedLightFeatures) {\n        node.light?.type = .directional\n        node.light?.intensity = physicallyBasedLightFeatures.lumen\n        node.light?.temperature = physicallyBasedLightFeatures.temperature\n    }\n\n    private func activateShadow() {\n        node.light?.castsShadow = true\n        node.light?.orthographicScale = 10\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs for the basic light, we create also for the physically based features a class that will store the configuration and\nthat must be injected at construction time (as you can see from the previous class init), that we will\ncall `PhysicallyBasedLightFeatures`.\n\n```swift\nclass PhysicallyBasedLightFeatures {\n    let lumen: CGFloat\n    let temperature: CGFloat\n\n    init(lumen: CGFloat, temperature: CGFloat) {\n        self.lumen = lumen\n        self.temperature = temperature\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor physically based rendering we need also another kind of lighting setup to achieve the best result. We need to set up\nthe `SCNScene`, the object that contains all the `SCNNode` elements of a scene, the `lightingEnviroment`\nand `background` properties. These ones let SceneKit approximate more accurately the indirect lighting calculation. To\nset this features we create a new class, `PhysicallyBasedLightingEnviroment`, that will receive the scene to setup. On\nthis class will set a cubemap on the `lightingEnviroment.contents` property and its intensity on\nthe `lightingEnviroment.intensity` property. To match the result of this lighting setup, it will set\nthe `background.contents` with the same cubemap used for the `lightingEnviroment.contents` property.\n\n```swift\nclass PhysicallyBasedLightingEnviroment {\n    let cubeMap: [String]\n    let intensity: CGFloat\n\n    init(cubeMap: [String], intensity: CGFloat) {\n        self.cubeMap = cubeMap\n        self.intensity = intensity\n    }\n\n    func setLightingEnviromentFor(scene: SCNScene) {\n        scene.lightingEnvironment.contents = cubeMap\n        scene.lightingEnvironment.intensity = intensity\n        scene.background.contents = cubeMap\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext step: the camera. We create a `Camera` class, that will contain a reference, again, to a `SCNNode` on which\nan `SCNCamera` has been defined. For the camera we need to set first of all some geometric properties like the position,\nrotation and the pivot point that we will use as reference for the animation of the camera. Last but not least we set\nthe flag `wantHDR` to apply [High Dynamic Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range \"High Dynamic Range\")\npost processing to adjust the general brightness of the scene with respect to the display.\n\n```swift\nclass Camera {\n    let node: SCNNode\n\n    init(cameraNode: SCNNode, wantsHDR: Bool = false) {\n        node = cameraNode\n        setAdvancedFeatures(wantsHDR: wantsHDR)\n    }\n\n    init(position: SCNVector3, rotation: SCNVector4, wantsHDR: Bool = false, pivot: SCNMatrix4? = nil) {\n        node = SCNNode()\n        createCameraOnNode()\n        setAdvancedFeatures(wantsHDR: wantsHDR)\n        set(position: position, rotation: rotation, pivot: pivot)\n    }\n\n    private func createCameraOnNode() {\n        node.camera = SCNCamera()\n    }\n\n    private func setAdvancedFeatures(wantsHDR: Bool) {\n        node.camera?.automaticallyAdjustsZRange = true\n        node.camera?.wantsHDR = wantsHDR\n    }\n\n    private func set(position aPosition: SCNVector3, rotation aRotation: SCNVector4, pivot aPivot: SCNMatrix4?) {\n        node.position = aPosition\n        node.rotation = aRotation\n        node.pivot = aPivot ?? node.pivot\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow it's time to think about the objects we want to display in the scene. For that reason we create a `Object` class\nthat will represent each kind of object we want to show in the scene. Obviously as for the previous classes, also\nthe `Object` class will expose a `node` property of type `SCNNode` that represents our object in the scene. We define\nthis class with multiple initializer that let as create object instances using various configurations: init as an empty\nobject, init using a `SCNGeometry` instance, using a mesh loaded as a `MDLObject` using\nthe [Model I\\O](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio \"Model I\\O\") Apple framework. This framework let us\nimport/export 3D models in a wide range of common available formats.\n\n```swift\nclass Object {\n    let node: SCNNode\n\n    init(position: SCNVector3, rotation: SCNVector4) {\n        node = SCNNode()\n        node.castsShadow = true\n        set(position: position, rotation: rotation)\n    }\n\n    init(geometry: SCNGeometry, position: SCNVector3, rotation: SCNVector4) {\n        node = SCNNode(geometry: geometry)\n        node.castsShadow = true\n        set(position: position, rotation: rotation)\n    }\n\n    init(mesh: MDLObject, position: SCNVector3, rotation: SCNVector4) {\n        node = SCNNode(mdlObject: mesh)\n        node.castsShadow = true\n        set(position: position, rotation: rotation)\n    }\n\n    private func set(position: SCNVector3, rotation: SCNVector4) {\n        node.position = position\n        node.rotation = rotation\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we are ready to define a `PhysicallyBasedObject` class that will inherit all the capabilities of the `Object` class\nand will set all the features needed to make the object rendered using physically based rendering. Even if all the\ninitializer are available to this subclass, we will require a mesh as `MDLObject` at construction time, because we will\ndisplay some particular mesh objects (we will discuss about them later). At construction time we will require also the\nposition and rotation and the `PhysicallyBasedMaterial` material. By assigning it to the `firstMaterial` property of\nthe `geometry` of our node, our object will be rendered as a physically based object using the SceneKit physically based\nrendering engine. NB: the mesh that we will use doesn't contain any material so by assigning the `firstMaterial`\nproperty the mesh will use it for the entire surface.\n\n```swift\nclass PhysicallyBasedObject: Object {\n\n    init(mesh: MDLObject, material: PhysicallyBasedMaterial, position: SCNVector3, rotation: SCNVector4) {\n        super.init(mesh: mesh, position: position, rotation: rotation)\n        node.geometry?.firstMaterial = material.material\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo, the next question is: how do we define the `PhysicallyBasedMaterial` class? We create `PhysicallyBasedMaterial` with\na single property `material` of type `SCNMaterial`. On this material property we set:\n\n* the `lightingModel` to `.physicallyBased`, to mark it for SceneKit as a physically based material\n* `diffuse.contents` property with an appropriate diffuse value.\n* `roughness.contents` property with an appropriate roughness value.\n* `metalness.contents` property with an appropriate metalness value.\n* `normal.contents` property with an appropriate normal value.\n* `ambientOcclusion.contents` property with an appropriate ambient occlusion value\n\nAs you can see, we have all the properties we discussed in\nmy [introduction to physically based rendering post](/2017/12/07/physically-base-rendering-introduction/ \"physically \nbased introduction post\")\n. We have also other properties that help us improve the realism, especially with indirect lighting for what concern\nthe [ambient occlusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion \"ambient occlusion\") (this property/technique is\nnot related to PBR but helps to improve the final rendering). Which kind of values accept this properties? As stated in\nthe Apple documentation you can assign to the `contents` property:\n\n* a color (`NSColor`/`UIColor`/`CGColor`)\n* a number (`NSNumber`)\n* an image (`NSImage`/`UIImage`/`CGImage`)\n* a string\n* a `CALayer`\n* a texture (`SKTexture`/`MDLTexture`/`MTLTexture`/`GLKTextureInfo`)\n* a `SKScene`\n* an array of six image that represents a cube map (as we did for the `lightingEnviroment.contents property`).\n\n```swift\nclass PhysicallyBasedMaterial {\n    let material: SCNMaterial\n\n    init(diffuse: Any, roughness: Any, metalness: Any, normal: Any, ambientOcclusion: Any? = nil) {\n        material = SCNMaterial()\n        material.lightingModel = .physicallyBased\n        material.diffuse.contents = diffuse\n        material.roughness.contents = roughness\n        material.metalness.contents = metalness\n        material.normal.contents = normal\n        material.ambientOcclusion.contents = ambientOcclusion\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow it's time to construct our scene :relieved:!! We start by creating a new class `PhysicallyBasedScene`, subclass\nof `SCNScene`. In this way we can customize the default initializer with the step needed to add all the element of our\nscene, and also because in this way we have direct access to all the properties of `SCNScene`. We define a\nprotocol, `Scene`, that we will use to manage some gesture and animate the scene. So in the initializer we will call\nthree methods: `createCamera()` in which we will create the camera, `createLight()` in which we will create the\nlights, `createObjects()` in which we will create the objects. NB: we need to define also the initializer with coder\nbecause we are subclassing a class that adopt the `NSSecureCoding` that is an extension of the `NSCoding` protocol that\nhas this required initializer.\n\n```swift\n@objc class PhysicallyBasedScene: SCNScene, Scene {\n    var camera: Camera!\n\n    override init() {\n        super.init()\n        createCamera()\n        createLight()\n        createObjects()\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\n\n    ...\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nSo we start by creating our camera. We place it in front of the scene with the pivot moved a little bit and HDR post\nprocessing activated.\n\n```swift\nprivate func createCamera() {\n    camera = Camera(\n        position: SCNVector3Make(0, 2, 0),\n        rotation: SCNVector4Make(1, 0, 0, GLKMathDegreesToRadians(-5)),\n        wantsHDR: true,\n        pivot: SCNMatrix4MakeTranslation(0, 0, -8)\n    )\n    rootNode.addChildNode(camera.node)\n}\n```\n\nThen we create our lights. We create a physically based light with power of 100 lumen and a color temperature of 4000K.\nIn this way we can match the warm orange color of the cubemap used for the lighting environment that we set in the\nscene.\n\n```swift\nprivate func createLight() {\n    rootNode.addChildNode(createPhysicallyBasedLight().node)\n    createPhysicallyLightingEnviroment()\n}\n\nprivate func createPhysicallyBasedLight() -> PhysicallyBasedLight {\n    let lightFeatures = LightFeatures(\n        position: SCNVector3Make(-2, 5, 4),\n        orientation: SCNVector3Make(GLKMathDegreesToRadians(-45), GLKMathDegreesToRadians(-25), 0),\n        color: UIColor.white\n    )\n    let physicallyBasedLightFeatures = PhysicallyBasedLightFeatures(lumen: 100, temperature: 4000)\n    let physicallyBasedLight = PhysicallyBasedLight(\n        lightFeatures: lightFeatures,\n        physicallyBasedLightFeatures: physicallyBasedLightFeatures\n    )\n    return physicallyBasedLight\n}\n\nprivate func createPhysicallyLightingEnviroment() {\n    let enviroment = PhysicallyBasedLightingEnviroment(\n        cubeMap: [\"rightPBR.png\", \"leftPBR.png\", \"upPBR.png\", \"downPBR.png\", \"backPBR.png\", \"frontPBR.png\"],\n        intensity: 1.0\n    )\n    enviroment.setLightingEnviromentFor(scene: self)\n}\n```\n\nFinally we can place our 4 objects: one basic plane mesh and 3 mesh taken from\nthe [Stanford scan repository](https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/ \"Stanford scan repository\"). These mesh\nare: the dragon, the happy buddha and Lucy. All this meshes will be rendered using the `PhysicallyBasedObject`. We take\nthe textures used to model the various material from [freepbr](https://freepbr.com \"freepbr\") website.\n\n```swift\nprivate func createObjects() {\n    addFloor()\n    addDragon()\n    addBuddha()\n    addLucy()\n}\n\nprivate func addFloor() {\n    let floor = PhysicallyBasedObject(\n        mesh: MeshLoader.loadMeshWith(name: \"Floor\", ofType: \"obj\"),\n        material: PhysicallyBasedMaterial(\n            diffuse: \"floor-diffuse.png\",\n            roughness: NSNumber(value: 0.8),\n            metalness: \"floor-metalness.png\",\n            normal: \"floor-normal.png\",\n            ambientOcclusion: \"floor-ambient-occlusion.png\"\n        ),\n        position: SCNVector3Make(0, 0, 0),\n        rotation: SCNVector4Make(0, 0, 0, 0)\n    )\n    rootNode.addChildNode(floor.node)\n}\n\nprivate func addDragon() {\n    let dragon = PhysicallyBasedObject(\n        mesh: MeshLoader.loadMeshWith(name: \"Dragon\", ofType: \"obj\"),\n        material: PhysicallyBasedMaterial(\n            diffuse: \"rustediron-diffuse.png\",\n            roughness: NSNumber(value: 0.3),\n            metalness: \"rustediron-metalness.png\",\n            normal: \"rustediron-normal.png\"\n        ),\n        position: SCNVector3Make(-2, 0, 3),\n        rotation: SCNVector4Make(0, 1, 0, GLKMathDegreesToRadians(20))\n    )\n    rootNode.addChildNode(dragon.node)\n}\n\nprivate func addBuddha() {\n    let buddha = PhysicallyBasedObject(\n        mesh: MeshLoader.loadMeshWith(name: \"HappyBuddha\", ofType: \"obj\"),\n        material: PhysicallyBasedMaterial(\n            diffuse: \"cement-diffuse.png\",\n            roughness: NSNumber(value: 0.8),\n            metalness: \"cement-metalness.png\",\n            normal: \"cement-normal.png\",\n            ambientOcclusion: \"cement-ambient-occlusion.png\"\n        ),\n        position: SCNVector3Make(-0.5, 0, 0),\n        rotation: SCNVector4Make(0, 0, 0, 0)\n    )\n    rootNode.addChildNode(buddha.node)\n}\n\nprivate func addLucy() {\n    let lucy = PhysicallyBasedObject(\n        mesh: MeshLoader.loadMeshWith(name: \"Lucy\", ofType: \"obj\"),\n        material: PhysicallyBasedMaterial(\n            diffuse: \"copper-diffuse.png\",\n            roughness: NSNumber(value: 0.0),\n            metalness: \"copper-metalness.png\",\n            normal: \"copper-normal.png\"\n        ),\n        position: SCNVector3Make(2, 0, 2),\n        rotation: SCNVector4Make(0, 0, 0, 0)\n    )\n    rootNode.addChildNode(lucy.node)\n}\n```\n\nThe meshes are stored as [wavefront obj file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file \"wavefront obj file\") (\nthe easiest file format of all time :relieved:). As you can see from the previous code, we use a class\ncalled `MeshLoader`. How does it work? It uses\nthe [Model I/O](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio \"Model I/O\") Apple framework to load the obj file as\na `MDLAsset` and then we extract the first `MDLObject`.\n\n```swift\nclass MeshLoader {\n\n    static func loadMeshWith(name: String, ofType type: String) -> MDLObject {\n        let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: name, ofType: type)!\n        let asset = MDLAsset(url: URL(fileURLWithPath: path))\n        return asset[0]!\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe are almost ready to render our scene. The last thing to do is to implement the methods of the `Scene` protocol to add\nsome movement to the scene. This method will be called by a one tap gesture attached to the main view that will render\nour scene (we will see it in a few moments). Inside it we use the method `runAction` to rotate the camera around its\npivot, that we moved previously to have a rotation axis to move the camera around the scene.\n\n```swift\nfunc actionForOnefingerGesture(withLocation location: CGPoint, andHitResult hitResult: [Any]!) {\n    self.camera.node.runAction(SCNAction.rotate(by: CGFloat(GLKMathDegreesToRadians(360)),\n                                                around: SCNVector3Make(0, 1, 0),\n                                                duration: 30))\n}\n```\n\nWe are ready to render our scene. Assign an instance of our `PhysicallyBasedScene` to a `SCNView` and see the beautiful\nresults of our work. Below you can find a video of the scene we created.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDMdAtv-3Bg`\n\nThat's it!! You've made it!! Now you can show to your friends your physically based scene and be proud of it :\nsunglasses:. You can find this example with other scenes\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Exploring-SceneKit \"Exploring-SceneKit repo\").\n","slug":"/2018/01/03/scene-kit-physically-based-rendering/","description":"Let's try to build a scene using SceneKit and its physically based rendering features.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"7bedc070-0e9c-5aa2-b358-8724ae6ebfd6":{"title":"Model View Presenter on Android: unit test for everything","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about the model view presenter architectural pattern and how it can improve you unit test and\nyour TDD workflow when developing an Android application.*\n\n---\n\nIn\na [previous post](/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/ \"model view presenter ios post\")\nI talked about the [Model View Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter \"Model view presenter\")\narchitectural pattern and how it could help you to develop apps fully tested. But what about Android? Can we reach the\nsame level of testability using this pattern and improve our TDD workflow? Let's find it out :smirk:!!  \nIn this post we will try to develop the same application we developed on iOS in\nthe [previous post](/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/ \"model view presenter ios post\"):\na simple product catalog that shows a list of products. When you tap on one of them, its details is shown. Below you can\nfind the same mockup we used for the iOS version.\n\n![A mockup of the final app we will obtain at the end of this post](../images/posts/mockup-model-view-presenter.jpg)\n\nLet's start by creating a `Product` class. We need also to create a `ProductsRepository` class: in our case it will be a\nfake one that return to listener a list of products after 3 seconds. We do this to simulate a web service call. This is\nour implementation for the `Product` class:\n\n```java\npublic class Product {\n    private String name;\n    private String description;\n    private String image;\n\n    public Product(String name, String description, String image) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.description = description;\n        this.image = image;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return description;\n    }\n\n    public String getImage() {\n        return image;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd below there is the implementation of our `ProductsRepository`.\n\n```java\npublic class ProductsRepository implements Repository {\n    private ProductsRepositoryListener productsRepositoryListener;\n\n    @Override\n    public void setListener(ProductsRepositoryListener productsRepositoryListener) {\n        this.productsRepositoryListener = productsRepositoryListener;\n    }\n\n    public void get() {\n        new Timer().schedule(new TimerTask() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                Product[] products = {\n                    new Product(\"Car\", \"A beautiful car\", \"car\"),\n                    new Product(\"Book\", \"\", \"book\")\n                };\n                productsRepositoryListener.onRetrieved(products);\n            }\n        }, 3000);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs we said before, and as you can see above the repository return to a `ProductsRepositoryListener` the list of\nproducts. So the interface definition for that listener is:\n\n```java\npublic interface ProductsRepositoryListener {\n    void onRetrieved(Product[] products);\n}\n```\n\nNow we can start to create our presenter. First of all we will define a `ProductsView` that will be responsible to\nimplement the real platform dependent UI code. Our presenter will be responsible for:\n\n* **the start of the view in the**  `onStart()` method. In this method it will update the view title, show a loading\n  status and more important it will start the retrieve of the product list and become its listener.\n* **listening to the repository callback when the products are retrieve**. So our presenter will implement\n  the `ProductsRepositoryListener` interface and pass to the view the updated product list.\n* **the show detail action in the** `onSelected(Product product)` method. In this case it will need to check that we\n  have a valid product and eventually show its detail (or an error message).\n\nFirst let's see our `ProductsView` interface:\n\n```java\npublic interface ProductsView {\n    void showLoadingStatus();\n    void hideLoadingStatus();\n    void show(String title);\n    void show(Product[] products);\n    void showErrorWith(String message);\n    void showDetailFor(Product product);\n}\n```\n\nOur `ProductsPresenter` implementation will be the following:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductsPresenter implements ProductsRepositoryListener {\n    private ProductsView productsView;\n    private Repository productsRepository;\n\n    public ProductsPresenter(ProductsView productsView, Repository productsRepository) {\n        this.productsView = productsView;\n        this.productsRepository = productsRepository;\n    }\n\n    public void onStart() {\n        productsView.show(\"Products\");\n        productsView.showLoadingStatus();\n        productsRepository.setListener(this);\n        productsRepository.get();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRetrieved(Product[] products) {\n        tryToShowTheProducts(products);\n        productsView.hideLoadingStatus();\n    }\n\n    private void tryToShowTheProducts(Product[] products) {\n        if (isValidProduct(products)) {\n            productsView.show(products);\n        } else {\n            productsView.showErrorWith(\"No products available\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private boolean isValidProduct(Product[] products) {\n        return products != null;\n    }\n\n    public void onSelected(Product product) {\n        if (hasValidDescription(product)) {\n            productsView.showDetailFor(product);\n        } else {\n            productsView.showErrorWith(\"Product without description\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private boolean hasValidDescription(Product product) {\n        return !product.getDescription().equals(\"\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd this are our presenter tests:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductsPresenterTest {\n    private ProductsView productsView;\n    private Repository productsRepository;\n    private ProductsPresenter productsPresenter;\n    private final Product[] products  = new Product[]{new Product(\"aName\", \"aDescription\", \"anImage\")};\n    private final Product product  = new

see that with our presenter we are able to test, also on Android, each UI operation without have to deal\nwith platform dependent code in our unit test. As you can see our unit test are written, as on iOS, following the\ntypical [Behaviour Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development \"Behaviour Driven Development\")\ngiven-than-when approach. Now the same question we had in the iOS version of the app will start floating around in your\nhead: who is our view? Fragments!!! On Android we will use fragments as our View for all the UI operation :sunglasses:.\nSo let's see our `ProductsFragment` implementation:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductsFragment extends Fragment implements ProductsView {\n    private RecyclerView productsRecyclerView;\n    private ProductsPresenter productsPresenter;\n    private LinearLayoutManager productsLinearLayoutManager;\n    private ProgressBar productsProgressBar;\n    private ProductsNavigator productsNavigator;\n\n    public static ProductsFragment newInstance(ProductsNavigator productsNavigator) {\n        ProductsFragment productsFragment = new ProductsFragment();\n        productsFragment.productsNavigator = productsNavigator;\n        return productsFragment;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,\n                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_products, container, false);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onViewCreated(View view, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);\n        bindViews();\n        initializeDependencies();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onResume() {\n        super.onResume();\n        productsPresenter.onStart();\n    }\n\n    private void initializeDependencies() {\n        ProductsRepository productsRepository = new ProductsRepository();\n        productsPresenter = new ProductsPresenter(this, productsRepository);\n    }\n\n    private void setupProductRecyclerViewUsing(final Product[] products) {\n        getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                setupLayoutManager();\n                setupStyle();\n                setupAdapterUsing(products);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    private void setupAdapterUsing(Product[] products) {\n        ProductsAdapter productsAdapter = new ProductsAdapter(products, productsPresenter);\n        productsRecyclerView.setAdapter(productsAdapter);\n    }\n\n    private void setupLayoutManager() {\n        productsLinearLayoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(getActivity());\n        productsRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(productsLinearLayoutManager);\n    }\n\n    private void setupStyle() {\n        productsRecyclerView.setHasFixedSize(true);\n        DividerItemDecoration dividerItemDecoration = new DividerItemDecoration(\n                productsRecyclerView.getContext(),\n                productsLinearLayoutManager.getOrientation());\n        productsRecyclerView.addItemDecoration(dividerItemDecoration);\n    }\n\n    private void bindViews() {\n        productsProgressBar = (ProgressBar) getView().findViewById(R.id.products_progress_bar);\n        productsRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) getView().findViewById(R.id.products_recycler_view);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void showLoadingStatus() {\n        productsProgressBar.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void hideLoadingStatus() {\n        getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                productsProgressBar.setVisibility(View.GONE);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void show(String title) {\n        getActivity().setTitle(title);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void show(Product[] products) {\n        setupProductRecyclerViewUsing(products);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void showErrorWith(final String message) {\n        getActivity().runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                showErrorAlertWith(message);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    private void showErrorAlertWith(String message) {\n        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());\n        builder.setMessage(message)\n                .setTitle(R.string.dialog_error_title)\n                .setPositiveButton(R.string.dialog_error_ok_button, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {\n                    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {\n                        dialog.dismiss();\n                    }\n                });\n        AlertDialog errorAlert = builder.create();\n        errorAlert.show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void showDetailFor(Product product) {\n        productsNavigator.goToDetailOf(product);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see it implements all the UI operation we defined in our view as the `UIViewController` do on iOS. But if you\nlook well we have a little difference between the two platform. In the Android platform the tap on a product is managed\nin the adapter, so the presenter is passed to this component to manage the product selection. Let's see the\nimplementation of our `ProductsPresenter`:\n\n```java\nclass ProductsAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<ProductsAdapter.ViewHolder> {\n    private Product[] products;\n    private ProductsPresenter productsPresenter;\n\n    ProductsAdapter(Product[] products, ProductsPresenter productsPresenter) {\n        this.products = products;\n        this.productsPresenter = productsPresenter;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View rowProductView = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.row_product, parent, false);\n        return new ViewHolder(rowProductView, productsPresenter);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {\n        holder.textView.setText(products[position].getName());\n        holder.product = products[position];\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return products.length;\n    }\n\n    static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener {\n        private ProductsPresenter productsPresenter;\n        TextView textView;\n        Product product;\n\n        ViewHolder(View itemView, ProductsPresenter productsPresenter) {\n            super(itemView);\n            textView = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.product_name_text_view);\n            textView.setOnClickListener(this);\n            this.productsPresenter = productsPresenter;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n            productsPresenter.onSelected(product);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere's also another little difference between the Android and the iOS version. If you look carefully in\nthe `showDetailFor(Product product)` method, that is called after the product selected is checked in the presenter,\nthere is another component responsible to manage the navigation between the screen of our app. In particular, the screen\nof our app will be `Fragment` objects and there will be an `Activity`, the `ProductsActivity`, that will implement\nthe `ProductsNavigator` interface and will be responsible to manage the correct navigation between fragments in the app.\nLet's see in order the `ProductsNavigator` interface:\n\n```java\npublic interface ProductsNavigator {\n    void goToDetailOf(Product product);\n}\n```\n\nAnd the `ProductsActivity` implementation:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductsActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements ProductsNavigator {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_products);\n        Toolbar toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar);\n        setSupportActionBar(toolbar);\n        showFragment(ProductsFragment.newInstance(this));\n    }\n\n    private void showFragment(Fragment fragment) {\n        FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = getFragmentManager().beginTransaction();\n        fragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimations(\n                R.animator.enter,\n                R.animator.exit,\n                R.animator.pop_enter,\n                R.animator.pop_exit\n        );\n        fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.products_activity_content, fragment);\n        fragmentTransaction.addToBackStack(\"ProductsStack\");\n        fragmentTransaction.commit();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void goToDetailOf(Product product) {\n        showFragment(ProductDetailFragment.newInstance(product));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n        switch (item.getItemId()) {\n            case android.R.id.home:\n                onBackPressed();\n                break;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBackPressed() {\n        if (getFragmentManager().getBackStackEntryCount() > 1) {\n            getFragmentManager().popBackStack();\n        } else {\n            finish();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOk, now we are ready to implement our product detail. First of all we define the new `ProductDetailView`:\n\n```java\npublic interface ProductDetailView {\n    void show(String title);\n    void show(Product product);\n    void showErrorWith(String message);\n}\n```\n\nAnd then our presenter:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductDetailPresenter {\n    private ProductDetailView productDetailView;\n    private Product product;\n\n    public ProductDetailPresenter(ProductDetailView productDetailView, Product product) {\n        this.productDetailView = productDetailView;\n        this.product = product;\n    }\n\n    public void onStart() {\n        productDetailView.show(\"Product\");\n        if (isValidProduct()) {\n            productDetailView.show(product);\n        } else {\n            productDetailView.showErrorWith(\"Product not valid\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    private boolean isValidProduct() {\n        return product != null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd its unit tests:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductDetailPresenterTest {\n    private ProductDetailPresenter productDetailPresenter;\n    private ProductDetailView productDetailView;\n    private Product product;\n\n    @Test\n    public void onStartWithValidProduct() throws Exception {\n        givenAValidProduct();\n        givenAProductDetailView();\n        givenAProductDetailPresenter();\n        whenThePresenterStarts();\n        thenTheTitleIsShown();\n        thenTheProductDetailIsShown();\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void onStartWithInvalidProduct() throws Exception {\n        givenAnInvalidProduct();\n        givenAProductDetailView();\n        givenAProductDetailPresenter();\n        whenThePresenterStarts();\n        thenTheTitleIsShown();\n        thenAnErrorMessageIsDisplayed();\n    }\n\n    private void givenAValidProduct() {\n        product = new Product(\"aName\", \"aDescription\", \"anImage\");\n    }\n\n    private void givenAnInvalidProduct() {\n        product = null;\n    }\n\n    private void givenAProductDetailView() {\n        productDetailView = mock(ProductDetailView.class);\n    }\n\n    private void givenAProductDetailPresenter() {\n        productDetailPresenter = new ProductDetailPresenter(productDetailView, product);\n    }\n\n    private void whenThePresenterStarts() {\n        productDetailPresenter.onStart();\n    }\n\n    private void thenTheProductDetailIsShown() {\n        verify(productDetailView).show(product);\n    }\n\n    private void thenTheTitleIsShown() {\n        verify(productDetailView).show(anyString());\n    }\n\n    private void thenAnErrorMessageIsDisplayed() {\n        verify(productDetailView).showErrorWith(anyString());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd finally our `ProductDetailFragment`:\n\n```java\npublic class ProductDetailFragment extends Fragment implements ProductDetailView {\n    private Product product;\n    private ImageView productImageView;\n    private TextView productNameTextView;\n    private TextView productDescriptionTextView;\n    private ProductDetailPresenter productDetailPresenter;\n\n    public static ProductDetailFragment newInstance(Product product) {\n        ProductDetailFragment productDetailFragment = new ProductDetailFragment();\n        productDetailFragment.product = product;\n        return productDetailFragment;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,\n                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_product_detail, container, false);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onViewCreated(View view, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);\n        bindViews();\n        initializeDependencies();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onResume() {\n        super.onResume();\n        productDetailPresenter.onStart();\n    }\n\n    private void bindViews() {\n        productImageView = (ImageView) getActivity().findViewById(R.id.product_image_detail_image_view);\n        productNameTextView = (TextView) getActivity().findViewById(R.id.product_name_detail_text_view);\n        productDescriptionTextView = (TextView) getActivity().findViewById(R.id.product_description_detail_text_view);\n    }\n\n    private void initializeDependencies() {\n        productDetailPresenter = new ProductDetailPresenter(this, product);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void show(String title) {\n        getActivity().setTitle(title);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void show(Product product) {\n        productImageView.setImageDrawable(getActivity().getDrawable(getActivity().getResources().getIdentifier(\n                product.getImage(),\n                \"drawable\",\n                getActivity().getPackageName()\n        )));\n        productNameTextView.setText(product.getName());\n        productDescriptionTextView.setText(product.getDescription());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void showErrorWith(String message) {\n        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getActivity());\n        builder.setMessage(message)\n                .setTitle(R.string.dialog_error_title)\n                .setPositiveButton(R.string.dialog_error_ok_button, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {\n                    public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int id) {\n                        dialog.dismiss();\n                    }\n                });\n        AlertDialog errorAlert = builder.create();\n        errorAlert.show();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it!!!!!

Let's do it now!*\n\n---\n\nSome months ago\nI [transformed my website into a Progressive Web App](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"pwa\") (\nyes, the one you're reading now). By leveraging the power of service workers (and other some cool tricks that I will\ndiscuss in other posts :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) my website page load time is below 50 milliseconds :open_mouth:.\nBut with \"the great power of service workers comes also great responsibility\" (you\nremember [uncle Ben quote](https://www.google.com/search?q=from+great+power+comes+great+responsibility), right?), and\none of this responsibility is let the user be able to refresh all the content whenever it wants (to check new/update\nstuff). Which is a mechanism/UX pattern that every user in the world already know for this kind of functionality?\nThe [pull to refresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-to-refresh). The choice of this pattern is also a natural\nconsequence of the fact that,\nas [I already told you previously in another post](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"pwa\"), Progressive\nWeb App are the technology that fill the gap between web and mobile native app. Unfortunately in the web development\nworld there's not yet a standard component for pull to refresh. This is way in this post I will show you how to\nimplement it from scratch without any JavaScript library/framework. I will only use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and\nthe service worker *message* capabilities in combination with the `MessageChannel` class. The pull to refresh described\nin this article is available on this site in all the blog pages (including this one, try it now!!! :smirk:). Let's start\nfrom the implementation of the UI (HTML and CSS)\n\n#### UI: HTML and CSS\n\nYou already know what we would like to achieve. The pull to refresh UI component should be something that appears at the\ntop of the page when the user scroll beyond the page borders. At some point during the drag gesture the pull to refresh\nshould stop itself from scrolling and show a loader that explain to the user that the content is reloading. Let's start\nfrom the HTML. I added to the page structure a new div that will act as the container of the pull to refresh. Inside it\nI added two other divs:\n\n* one is used to show a loader/activity indicator that will start to rotate as soon as the user scroll to the maximum\n  pull to refresh point (and as already explained above, at this point the reload of the content should have been\n  started).\n\n* the other one is used to show a message to the user that explaining to him/her what it is happening (this is a nice to\n  have that I added because I liked it! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)\n\nBelow you can find the entire html code snippet.\n\n```html\n\n<div id=\"pull-to-refresh\" class=\"pull-to-refresh start-pull hidden-pull\">\n  <div id=\"pull-to-refresh-loader\" class=\"pull-to-refresh-loader\"></div>\n  <div id=\"pull-to-refresh-status\" class=\"pull-to-refresh-status\">\n    Pull down to refresh\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nLet's see what I did on the CSS side. The code reported below here is written\nin [SASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)) (the preprocessor scripting language that is\ninterpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)), but you can easily transform it in plain CSS if you need.\nFirst of all I used a new CSS property in the `html` rule: `overscroll-behavior-y`. This property let the developers\nchange the browser behaviour when the user researches the edge of the page with a scroll gesture. This is a property\nsupported by Chrome, Firefox and Opera (fuck you Safari!!! :rage:). By setting it's value to `contains`, we can for\nexample disable the native browser pull to refresh on Chrome and avoid the page bounce effect when the user starts to\noverflow the borders while dragging. Then I defined a property `pullable-content` that I used on the entire content of\nthe page that I want to move in parallel with the pull to refresh. The next class is `pull-to-refresh` and contains all\nthe styles needed to layout the pull to refresh in all its states. As you can see I defined all the animation I needed\nfor this UI component here except for the translation applied while dragging that will be computed on the JavaScript\nside (because this are simple animation\nand [CSS is performant enough for this kind of animations](https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/how-to-achieve-60-fps-animations-with-css3-db7b98610108))\n. Last but not least I defined 2 classes to reset the pull to refresh layout status when the pull to refresh is started\nor has reached the end and starts the refresh of the content (they will be applied, like other contained here, with\nJavaScript DOM API).\n\n```scss\nhtml {\n  overscroll-behavior-y: contain;\n}\n\n.pullable-content {\n  margin-top: 10px\n}\n\n.pull-to-refresh {\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: $general-background;\n  margin-top: 55px;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n  box-shadow: inset 0px -2px 6px 1px $divider-color;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n  align-items: center;\n  padding: 10px;\n\n  &.visible-pull {\n    visibility: visible;\n  }\n\n  &.hidden-pull {\n    visibility: hidden;\n  }\n\n  .pull-to-refresh-status {\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 14px;\n  }\n\n  .pull-to-refresh-loader {\n    border: 3px solid $primary-color-dark;\n    border-top: 3px solid $primary-color-light;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    width: 30px;\n    height: 30px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n    opacity: 0;\n\n    &.animate {\n      animation: spin 1.25s linear infinite;\n    }\n\n    @keyframes spin {\n      0% {\n        transform: rotate(0deg);\n      }\n      100% {\n        transform: rotate(360deg);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n.start-pull {\n  transform: translateY(-100px);\n}\n\n.end-pull {\n  transform: translateY(-100px) !important;\n  transition: 0.4s ease-in-out;\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nOn the JavaScript side, I wrote the the pull to refresh widget as a standalone widget that export one single\nfunction `pullToRefresh()`. The first thing that this widget does is to check the browser support for service worker.\nThen it checks for some HTML component that are needed by the widget by using the `invariant` function. This HTML\ncomponents are the loader, the loader message status and the content to be refreshed. The widget will throw an error if\none of this HTML component is not present on the page where the it is instantiated.  \nThen 3 new listener are attached to the 3 touches event on the entire document: `'touchstart'`, `'touchmove'`\nand `'touchend'`. In the `'touchstart'` event I get the starting touches coordinates and I prepare the pull to refresh\nDOM by adding the CSS classes needed with the function `preparePullToRefreshToStart()`. The `touchemove` is the core of\nthe widget. In this event I try to understand if the user is doing a drag gesture by using the\nfunction `isDraggingForPullToRefresh()` that does some checks using the `window.scrollY` property and the `yMovement`\ncalculated by doing the difference between the gesture starting coordinates (that I get from the `touchstart` event) and\nthe current touches coordinates.\n\n```javascript\nconst dragCurrentPoint = getTouchesCoordinatesFrom(event)\nconst yMovement = (dragStartPoint.y - dragCurrentPoint.y) * decelerationFactor\n```\n\nWhen I detect a drag gesture (so as we said above `isDraggingForPullToRefresh() == true`) I start to check if the pull\nto refresh is completed with the function `isPullToRefreshDragCompleted()`, that does a check to understand if the total\ndrag gesture movement is equal to pull to refresh contained DOM element. If this function return false, then the pull to\nrefresh DOM is updated by the function `dragUpdate()`, that applies some CSS transform that translate the pull to\nrefresh into the viewport to make it more and more visible (and increase the visibility of the loader that it is still\nstop).  \nWhen `isPullToRefreshDragCompleted()` is `true`, the user reached the end of the pull to refresh drag gesture and the\nrefresh of the content is started. How do I refresh the content? I send a message to the service worker using the\nfunction `sendMessageToServiceWorker` to refresh the content. When the service worker answers that the refresh of the\ncontent is completed we update the pull to refresh status with the message 'Refresh completed' and we close it using the\nfunctions `setRefreshStatusCompleted()` and `closePullToRefresh()`. In particular the `closePullToRefresh()` function\nlaunches a CSS transform transition animation to close the pull to refresh. To reload the content of the page when the\nanimation is completed I defined a `transitionend` listener attached to the `pullToRefreshElement` container element (\nthe one that is animated) that launches a `window.location.reload()` to reload the page and show the new fresh content.\nIn all this steps I keep track that the refresh phases completed correctly by setting some status flag in a status\nrepository that I create with the function `createPullToRefreshStatusRepository()`.\n\n```javascript\n//...other code...\nconst createPullToRefreshStatusRepository = () => ({\n  refreshStarted: false,\n  refreshCompleted: false,\n  startRefresh() {\n    this.refreshStarted = true\n  },\n  completeRefresh() {\n    this.refreshCompleted = true\n  }\n})\n//...other code...\n```\n\nAs I said before, each flag is updated when the correct phase is completed (e.g. a touch listener is launched or the\nservice worker warn us that the refresh is completed).  \nBelow you can find the complete pull to refresh widget code discussed above. Inside it there are also some utilities\nclasses that I use on my website to increase the compatibility on older browser (in this case used only to keep\nconsistencies in the entire website JavaScript code case because a modern browser with Service Worker support is\nrequired).\n\n```javascript\nimport { sendMessageToServiceWorker } from '../common/service-worker'\nimport { addCssClass, removeCssClass } from '../common/css-class'\nimport { getTrackingClientId } from '../common/tracking'\n\nconst pullToRefresh = (trackingCategory) => {\n  if (!('serviceWorker' in navigator)) {\n    return\n  }\n\n  const pullToRefreshElement = document.querySelector('#pull-to-refresh')\n  const pullToRefreshStatusElement = document.querySelector('#pull-to-refresh-status')\n  const pullToRefreshLoaderElement = document.querySelector('#pull-to-refresh-loader')\n  const pullableContent = document.querySelector('.pullable-content')\n\n  invariant(pullToRefreshElement instanceof HTMLElement)\n  invariant(pullToRefreshStatusElement instanceof HTMLElement)\n  invariant(pullToRefreshLoaderElement instanceof HTMLElement)\n  invariant(pullableContent instanceof HTMLElement)\n\n  const pullToRefreshElementHeight = pullToRefreshElement.offsetHeight\n  const pullToRefreshStatusRepository = createPullToRefreshStatusRepository()\n  const decelerationFactor = 0.5\n  let dragStartPoint = createTouchCoordinates(0, 0)\n\n  const dragUpdate = (dragMovement, pullToRefreshLoaderOpacity) => {\n    pullToRefreshElement.style.transform = `translateY(${dragMovement}px)`\n    pullableContent.style.transform = `translateY(${dragMovement}px)`\n    pullToRefreshLoaderElement.style.opacity = `${pullToRefreshLoaderOpacity}`\n  }\n\n  const isDraggingForPullToRefresh = (yMovement) => window.scrollY <= 0 && yMovement <= 0\n\n  const closePullToRefresh = () => {\n    addCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'end-pull')\n    addCssClass(pullableContent, 'end-pull')\n    pullToRefreshElement.style.transform = ''\n    pullableContent.style.transform = ''\n    pullToRefreshLoaderElement.style.opacity = '0'\n  }\n\n  const preparePullToRefreshToStart = () => {\n    addCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'start-pull')\n    removeCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'end-pull')\n    addCssClass(pullableContent, 'start-pull')\n    removeCssClass(pullableContent, 'end-pull')\n  }\n\n  const showPullToRefresh = () => {\n    addCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'visible-pull')\n    removeCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'hidden-pull')\n  }\n\n  const setRefreshingStatus = () => {\n    pullToRefreshStatusElement.innerHTML = 'Refreshing'\n    addCssClass(pullToRefreshLoaderElement, 'animate')\n  }\n\n  const isPullToRefreshDragCompleted = (yAbsoluteMovement) => yAbsoluteMovement >= pullToRefreshElementHeight\n\n  const setRefreshStatusCompleted = () => {\n    pullToRefreshStatusElement.innerHTML = 'Refresh completed'\n    addCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'hidden-pull')\n    removeCssClass(pullToRefreshElement, 'visible-pull')\n  }\n\n  const resetPullToRefreshStatus = () => {\n    pullToRefreshStatusElement.innerHTML = 'Pull down to refresh'\n    removeCssClass(pullToRefreshLoaderElement, 'animate')\n  }\n\n  document.addEventListener('touchstart', (event) => {\n    dragStartPoint = getTouchesCoordinatesFrom(event)\n    preparePullToRefreshToStart()\n  }, { passive: false })\n\n  document.addEventListener('touchmove', (event) => {\n    const dragCurrentPoint = getTouchesCoordinatesFrom(event)\n    const yMovement = (dragStartPoint.y -

Below you can find the startup code that I\nplaced inside a `load` event listener (that on my website code does also other things).\n\n```javascript\nimport { pullToRefresh } from './blog/pull-to-refresh'\n\n//...other code...\n\nwindow.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  //...other code...\n  pullToRefresh(trackingCategory)\n  //...other code...\n})\n```\n\n#### Service Worker\n\nOne thing I didn't show in detail is how we can achieve the communication between the JavaScript code that runs on the\nweb page and the service worker. In the code above I shown you the function `sendMessageToServiceWorker()`. What does\nthis function do? Inside it I create a new `MessageChannel` and bind its `port1.onmessage` listener to a new one created\nad-hoc to return the response that this function will receive from the service worker. The `port2` of\nthe `MessageChannel` is sent to the service worker along with the `message` string label using the\nfunction `postMessage` on the service worker container `controller` property. This property contains the current\ninstance of the service worker. If you already worker in the past on some IFrame communication, `postMessage` is not\nsomething new (it's the same function actually :smirk:).\n\n```javascript\nconst sendMessageToServiceWorker = (message) => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const messageChannel = new MessageChannel()\n    messageChannel.port1.onmessage = (event) => {\n      if (event.data) {\n        if (event.data.error) {\n          reject(event.data.error)\n        } else {\n          resolve(event.data)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if (navigator.serviceWorker && navigator.serviceWorker.controller) {\n      navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage(message, ([messageChannel.port2]))\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThen In the service worker I added a new `message` listener that receive all the messages sent with the function above.\nAt the moment I have only the `refresh` message. This is why all the code to manage this message is contained inside\nit (just to explain the reason to\nthe [clean code fluffy evangelist](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1190762799338790913) :sweat_smile:). In the\nlistener I check for the correctness of the event label, and then I start to clean up the cache from all the assets and\npages of the blog with (this is why for example the `createDeleteOperationsForImages` checks that the url contains\nthe `posts` path, in order to avoid the deletion of home images). This delete cache function are all execute in\na `Promise.all` call. When this function completes the execution of all the delete operation, I\ncall `sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient()` to warn the original JavaScript code (the `port1.onmessage` listener we saw\nabove) that the refresh operation has been completed.\n\n```javascript\n//...other service worker code...\n\nself.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\n  const isARefresh = (event) => event.data.message === 'refresh'\n\n  const createDeleteOperationFor = (url, siteCache, requests) => siteCache\n    .delete(requests\n      .find((request) => request.url === url))\n\n  const createDeleteOperationsForImages = (siteCache, requests) => requests\n    .filter((request) => request.url.endsWith('.jpg') && request.url.includes('posts'))\n    .map((request) => siteCache.delete(request))\n\n  const sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient = (event) => event.ports[0].postMessage({ refreshCompleted: true })\n\n  if (isARefresh(event)) {\n    caches.open(siteCacheName).then((siteCache) => {\n      siteCache.keys().then((requests) => {\n        const deleteRequestToBeRefreshed = createDeleteOperationFor(event.data.url, siteCache, requests)\n        const deleteRequestsForImagesToBeRefreshed = createDeleteOperationsForImages(siteCache, requests)\n        Promise.all([\n          deleteRequestToBeRefreshed,\n          ...deleteRequestsForImagesToBeRefreshed,\n          sendAnalyticsEvent(event.data.clientId, '{{ site.data.tracking.action.pull_to_refresh }}', event.data.trackingCategory, '{{ site.data.tracking.label.body }}')\n        ])\n          .then(() => sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient(event))\n          .catch(() => sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient(event))\n      })\n    })\n  }\n})\n\n//...other service worker code...\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAll the code above is everything needed to implement your own pull to refresh widget. As you can see, it is not too\ndifficult to create a pull to refresh UX that almost matches the experience given by a mobile native app. Service\nWorkers, modern CSS and HTML and vanilla JavaScript let you create beautiful native alike experience that can make you\nuser fall in love with you web product before they install your app :heart: (or maybe they will just stick to your site\nbecause they hate mobile apps or because you hate mobile apps and you don't want to develop a new one :smiley:).\n","slug":"/2019/11/16/pull-to-refresh-web/","description":"Implementing a pull to refresh component in vanilla js for your progressive web app (PWA) it's really easy.

I decided also to give a try to Workbox, a set of Google\nlibraries to improve the creation of a Progressive Web App. Let's see how easy it is to create a PWA with this tools.*\n\n---\n\nI already talked extensively in some previous post\nabout [what a progressive web app is](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"pwa\")\nand how it can improve the user experience of your website. In the first development iteration I create the service\nworker that runs on this website without any kind of library or framework to support. This enabled me to learn the\nfundamental of PWAs: how they work, their lifecycle and limits. Now that I gained enough experience it's time to move\non. Recently\nI [migrated this website to Webpack and TypeScript](/2020/06/02/dynamic-imports-webpack-chunks/ \"chunks webpack\").\nSo I thought: \"it's time also to improve my PWA codebase by leveraging some professional tool\". This is the reason why I\nchose to rewrite my service worker in Workbox. What is workbox?\n\n> JavaScript Libraries for adding offline support to web apps...Welcome, Workbox is a set of libraries and Node modules that make it easy to cache assets and take full advantage of features used to build Progressive Web Apps.\n\nAs the official description says, Workbox a TypeScript library that enable developers to build PWAs in a fast way by\ngiving to them the ability to have some already prepared component to manage all the aspects of a PWA: routing, caching,\ntracking etc. As reported on the official website Workbox is subdivided into modules, where each one of them covers a\ndifferent PWA feature.\n\n> * workbox-background-sync, use background sync to reliably make a network request even if the user is offline.\n>* workbox-broadcast-update, to send messages to pages (via Broadcast Channels) when a cache is updated with a new response.\n>* workbox-cacheable-response, to restrict which requests are cached based on a response's status code or headers.\n>* workbox-core, to alter log levels and change cache names via workbox-core. Contains shared code used by all Workbox libraries.\n>* workbox-expiration, removed cached requests based on the number of items in a cache or the age of the cached request.\n>* workbox-google-analytics, see how users are interacting with your site when they are offline.\n>* workbox-navigation-preload, enable navigation preload, to get a network response for navigation requests faster.\n>* workbox-precaching, easily precache a set of files and efficiently manage updates to files.\n>* workbox-range-request, this modules provides support for responding to a Range: request using a slice of previously cached data.\n>* workbox-routing, routes requests in your service worker to specific caching strategies or callback functions.\n>* workbox-strategies, a set of runtime caching strategies that will handle responding to a request, normally used with workbox-routing.\n>* workbox-streams, this modules provides support for composing a response from a series of streaming sources.\n\nSo let's see how I used it and how I took advantage of some of its major features, including the full integration with\nWebpack.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nAs I already said, Workbox is written in TypeScript. So let's start by creating a new file called `sw.ts`. The first\nthing we need to do is call some service worker lifecycle method, `skipWaiting` and `clientsClaim`. When you install an\nupdate of a service worker, the new one will not be used until you close all the tabs already controlled by the service\nworker and relaunch the web app. If you don't need that feature, you can make your new service worker activate sooner by\ncalling the `skipWaiting` function. In case you want to force all the tabs open to be immediately controller by a new\nupdated version of your service worker you can call `clientsClaim`. Both this lifecycle functions are contained in\nthe `workbox-core` module, so we can just import and call them.\n\n```typescript\nimport { skipWaiting, clientsClaim } from \"workbox-core\"\n\n//...other code...\n\nskipWaiting()\nclientsClaim()\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nNow we are ready to setup it's time to understand and setup caches with Workbox. All the caches inside the framework are\nbased on the concept of **routes** and **strategies**. Service worker can intercept network requests for a page and can\nrespond to the browser with cached content, content from the network or content generated in the service worker. To\ndefine which request must be intercepted and served by the service worker, you must define its **routes**. The way the\nservice worker handle the **routes** (for example cache only, network first etc.) are the **strategies**. Usually when\nyou write your own service worker you define some files to precache during the service worker installation process and\nthen for the routes you want to serve from it their related strategies.  \nLet's start with the precache of some files. This is usually done manually by the developer in the `install` event, and\nusually the resource that are cached are the ones needed in order to have the PWA work offline. In my cases, and\ngenerally speaking for a blog/news website, this basically means save in the cache JavaScript and CSS files. Workbox\ngive us the `precacheAndRoute` function to do this. It is possible to pass to this function a list of files to be cached\nand it will take care of creating an ad-hoc cache and same the files during the installation process. To build this\nwebsite I'm using Webpack as JavaScript bundler. Workbox has a great support for it. In particular for the precache\nphase, there is the npm package `workbox-webpack-plugin` that contains a plugin called `InjectManifest`. This plugin is\nable to inject in the Service Worker code a variable named `__WB_MANIFEST` that contains a list of the entry\npoints/generated files of the Webpack bundling process. So in my service worker I can precache the files I need by just\nwriting `precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST)`. Anyway there's a problem: I want to cache some additional files during\nthe installation process to be used to manage errors related to content not available in the caches and that it is not\npossible to load due to network errors. It is possible to add these additional files with the standard way in\nthe `install` event. In my case I decided to create an ad-hoc cache to save these files. Last but not least in the\ninstall event I decided also to clear all the caches. In this way on every install of a new service worker version I\nwill initialize all the caches. All the caches that I'm using are identified by the constants `CACHE_<purpose>` (and we\nwill see in a few moments how I'm using them :smirk:). Below you can find the code for the precache and install event.\n\n```typescript\nimport { precacheAndRoute } from 'workbox-precaching';\n\n//...other code...\n\nconst CACHE_PREFIX = 'workbox-chicio-coding'\nconst CACHE_OFFLINE_NAME = `${CACHE_PREFIX}-offline`\nconst CACHE_SCRIPT_NAME = `${CACHE_PREFIX}-scripts`\nconst CACHE_STYLES_NAME = `${CACHE_PREFIX}-styles`\nconst CACHE_DOCUMENTS_NAME = `${CACHE_PREFIX}-documents`\nconst CACHE_FONTS_NAME = `${CACHE_PREFIX}-fonts`\nconst CACHE_IMAGES_NAME = `${CACHE_PREFIX}-images`\n\nconst OFFLINE_PAGE_URL = '/offline.html'\nconst OFFLINE_PAGE_NO_NETWORK_IMAGE_URL = '/assets/images/no-wifi.png'\n\n//...other code...\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment\n// @ts-ignore: __WB_MANIFEST is a placeholder filled by workbox-webpack-plugin with the list of dependecies to be cached\nprecacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST)\ngoogleAnalytics.initialize()\n\nself.addEventListener('install', (event: ExtendableEvent) => {\n  const offlineUrls = [\n    OFFLINE_PAGE_URL,\n    OFFLINE_PAGE_NO_NETWORK_IMAGE_URL\n  ];\n  event.waitUntil(\n    Promise.all([\n      caches.delete(CACHE_DOCUMENTS_NAME),\n      caches.delete(CACHE_SCRIPT_NAME),\n      caches.delete(CACHE_STYLES_NAME),\n      caches.delete(CACHE_FONTS_NAME),\n      caches.delete(CACHE_IMAGES_NAME),\n      caches.open(CACHE_OFFLINE_NAME).then((cache) => cache.addAll(offlineUrls))\n    ])\n  );\n})\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nAfter the precache we define the routes and strategies for the network call after the install events. In my\nimplementation I decided to setup a cache for each one of the following assets:\n\n* styles (CSS files)\n* scripts (JavaScript files)\n* documents (HTML files)\n* fonts\n* images\n\nEach route is registered in the service worker with the `registerRoute` function. It expects 3 parameters: a regex that\ndefines the URLs intercepted by the route, a strategy handler and eventually the HTTP method expected on the route (the\nlast two parameters are optional and could be substituted by a `Route` object that contains this 3 params). In our case,\nas a consequence of the fact that I decided that all the routes must be served with a `CacheFirst` strategy, we can\ndefine a `registerRoute` function that defines a route with a cache first strategy given the regex of the route, the\ncache name and the `ExpirationPlugin`. What is an `ExpirationPlugin`? It is a class that define the retention policy of\nthe cache to which it is assigned. In our case I defined different `ExpirationPlugin` instances based on the policy I\nchosen for each media type supported by the routes we defined above:\n\n* 15 days for the styles\n* 180 days for the fonts\n* 60 days for the images\n* 60 days for the documents\n\nAbove you can see the implementation for the routes and strategies.\n\n```typescript\nimport { registerRoute, Route } from 'workbox-routing';\nimport { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration';\nimport { CacheFirst } from 'workbox-strategies';\n\n//...other code...\n\nconst stylesScriptsExpirationPlugin = new ExpirationPlugin({\n  maxEntries: 10,\n  maxAgeSeconds: 15 * 24 * 60 * 60,\n  purgeOnQuotaError: true\n})\nconst fontsExpirationPlugin = new ExpirationPlugin({ maxEntries: 5, maxAgeSeconds: 180 * 24 * 60 * 60 })\nconst imagesExpirationPlugin = new ExpirationPlugin({ maxEntries: 100, maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 24 * 60 * 60 })\nconst documentExpirationPlugin = new ExpirationPlugin({\n  maxEntries: 50,\n  maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 24 * 60 * 60,\n  purgeOnQuotaError: true\n})\n\n//...other code...\n\nconst registerCacheFirstRouteUsing = (\n  destination: RequestDestination,\n  cacheName: string,\n  expirationPlugin: ExpirationPlugin\n): Route => registerRoute(\n  ({ request }) => request.destination === destination,\n  new CacheFirst({\n    cacheName: cacheName,\n    plugins: [expirationPlugin],\n  })\n)\n\nregisterCacheFirstRouteUsing('style', CACHE_STYLES_NAME, stylesScriptsExpirationPlugin)\nregisterCacheFirstRouteUsing('script', CACHE_SCRIPT_NAME, stylesScriptsExpirationPlugin)\nregisterCacheFirstRouteUsing('document', CACHE_DOCUMENTS_NAME, documentExpirationPlugin)\nregisterCacheFirstRouteUsing('font', CACHE_FONTS_NAME, fontsExpirationPlugin)\nregisterCacheFirstRouteUsing('image', CACHE_IMAGES_NAME, imagesExpirationPlugin)\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nNow there's a question we didn't answer: how do we manage the requests that will fail? There are multiple possibilities\nto manage these cases. In our case I decided to go for a global catch handler. By calling `setCatchHandler` it is\npossible to catch all the network/cache error for all the routes defined. We can give a callback to this function where\nwe can define an error recovery strategy for each type of error. In our case we respond with the offline page (see the\noffline cache defined in the precache/install event) if the error happens on a resource of type `document` (so an html\npage that can be loaded completely), and we return a generic error for all the other fail (images loading fail, scripts\nfail etc.). Below you can find the implementation of the cache handler.\n\n```typescript\nimport { setCatchHandler } from 'workbox-routing';\n\n//...other code...\n\nsetCatchHandler((options: RouteHandlerCallbackOptions): Promise<Response> => {\n  const isADocumentRequest = (options: RouteHandlerCallbackOptions): boolean =>\n    !(typeof options.request === 'string') && options.request.destination == 'document';\n  const isAOfflinePageImageRequest = (options: RouteHandlerCallbackOptions): boolean =>\n    !(typeof options.request === 'string') &&\n    options.request.destination == 'image' &&\n    options.url?.pathname == OFFLINE_PAGE_NO_NETWORK_IMAGE_URL\n\n  if (isADocumentRequest(options)) {\n    return caches.match(OFFLINE_PAGE_URL) as Promise<Response>;\n  }\n\n  if (isAOfflinePageImageRequest(options)) {\n    return caches.match(OFFLINE_PAGE_NO_NETWORK_IMAGE_URL) as Promise<Response>;\n  }\n\n  return Promise.resolve(Response.error());\n})\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nAs a consequence of the fact that I'm migrating my previous version of the service worker for my website, I needed also\nto migrate the part that is responsible for getting messages from the page related to the pull to refresh. In this case\nthe previous version of the code was responsible for the clear of some caches. We can write this feature using\nthe `deleteCacheAndMetadata` method of the `ExpirationPlugin` class. Below you can find the related code.\n\n```typescript\n//...other code...\n\nself.addEventListener('message', (event: ExtendableMessageEvent) => {\n  const isARefresh = (event: ExtendableMessageEvent): boolean => event.data.message === 'refresh'\n  const sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient = (event: ExtendableMessageEvent): void => event.ports[0].postMessage({ refreshCompleted: true })\n\n  if (isARefresh(event)) {\n    Promise.all([\n      imagesExpirationPlugin.deleteCacheAndMetadata(),\n      documentExpirationPlugin.deleteCacheAndMetadata()\n    ])\n      .then(() => sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient(event))\n      .catch(() => sendRefreshCompletedMessageToClient(event))\n  }\n})\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nIn a [previous post](/2019/12/15/pwa-offiline-tracking-google-analytics/) I already talked about the fact that\nworkbox could help us to manage the Google Analytics tracking when the PWA is offline. So for this part, we just need (\nas in the previous version of my service worker) to call the `googleAnalytics.initialize()` function and workbox will\ntake care of:\n\n* store the analytics tracking occured while the app is offline\n* sync this tracking events to the server when a network connection is available again\n\n```typescript\nimport * as googleAnalytics from 'workbox-google-analytics';\n\n//...other code...\n\ngoogleAnalytics.initialize()\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nOne important thing to be noted here is that in my project I'm using TypeScript with the strict types activated and\nESLint. As a consequence of this fact I have to add two things to the code we saw above:\n\n* add a declaration in order to let TypeScript know that `self` is a `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope`\n* a `@ts-ignore` annotation to let TypeScript know that the `__WB_MANIFEST` will be available at compile time (Webpack\n  bundling), and an additional `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` comment to avoid ESLint\n  complaining about the `@tsignore` comment. :laughing:\n\n```typescript\n//...other code...\n\n// Fix self: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56356655/structuring-a-typescript-project-with-workers\ndeclare const self: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope;\nexport {};\n\n//...other code...\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment\n// @ts-ignore: __WB_MANIFEST is a placeholder filled by workbox-webpack-plugin with the list of dependecies to be cached\nprecacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST)\n\n//...other code...\n```\n\nNow that the service worker code has been migrated to Workbox you may ask if we can do something also for the service\nworker registration, and generaly speaking for all the service worker code inside the window context. The answer to this\nquestion is an additional workbox module called `workbox-window`. This module let the developers register their service\nworker and eventually use all its feature. In my case in the window context I'm doing 2 operation:\n\n* the service worker registration\n* I send a message to the service worker to clear some of the caches whenever a user starts a pull to refresh\n\nWe can wrote these feature by using an instance of `Workbox` and its two methods `register` and `messageSW`. Below you\ncan find the two function `registerToServicerWorker` and `sendMessageToServiceWorker` that I rewrote\nwith `workbox-window`.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Workbox } from \"workbox-window\";\n\ninterface ServiceWorkerMessage {\n  message: string;\n}\n\nconst wb = new Workbox('/sw.js')\n\nconst isServiceWorkerSupported: () => boolean = () => ('serviceWorker' in navigator)\n\nconst registerToServicerWorker = (): void => {\n  if (isServiceWorkerSupported()) {\n    wb.register()\n      .then(() => {\n        console.log('Service Worker registration completed')\n      })\n      .catch((err) => {\n        console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', err)\n      })\n  }\n}\n\nconst sendMessageToServiceWorker = (message: ServiceWorkerMessage): Promise<unknown> => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    wb.messageSW(message).then((event: MessageEvent): void => {\n      if (event.data) {\n        if (event.data.error) {\n          reject(event.data.error)\n        } else {\n          resolve(event.data)\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nexport { sendMessageToServiceWorker, registerToServicerWorker, isServiceWorkerSupported }\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAs you can see, writing a service worker with Typescript and Workbox is really easy. During the last time during my\ndaily job I'm basically doing more and more web development instead of mobile apps. I feel like I'm almost reaching the\nmythological status of the \"fullstack developer\". :laughing: Let's see what the future holds for me.\n","slug":"/2020/08/07/webpack-workbox-service-worker-typescript/","description":"Recently I migrated my website to Webpack and TypeScript.

Let's see how you can\nturn it on in your React Native application to get all its benefits.*\n\n---\n\nAs you already may know, there has been some complains in the past related to the performance of React Native on the\nAndroid platform. One of the main reason was due to a big difference in the React Native architecture implementation\nbetween Android and iOS: the JavaScript engine used to execute your code. On iOS React Native uses\nthe [JavaScript Core engine exposed in the iOS SDK](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore). On\nAndroid the SDK doesn't offer the same feature, so the React Native Android implementation embeds a compiled version of\nthe JavaScript Core engine. As a consequence of this fact the engine used on Android didn't receive the regular updates\nthat the iOS counterpart received on each system major update, and was also not optimized for React Native and generally\nspeaking for executing JavaScript code for mobiles apps. This is the reason why the Facebook React Native team decided\nto\ncreate [Hermes, an open source JavaScript engine optimized for mobile apps](https://engineering.fb.com/android/hermes/)\n.  \nWhich benefits does the new Engine bring to the table? As reported in the presentation blog post, there were a few key\nmetrics kept in consideration by the Facebook React Native team:\n\n> For JavaScript-based mobile applications, user experience benefits from attention to a few primary metrics:\n>\n>The time it takes for the app to become usable, called time to interact (TTI)\n> The download size (on Android, APK size)\n> Memory utilization\n\nThat seems really cool!! Hermes is available starting from React Native 0.60.4. Now the question is: how can you start\nto use it? Let's see how we enabled this new cool new engine in the [lm group](https://careers.lastminute.com/) mobile\napps (did you remember [how much we love React Native](/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/)?) while we\nwere doing the upgrade to the latest version of React Native in order to enable AndroidX in our apps.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe first thing to do is to set the `enableHermes` option to true in the React Native project configuration. This is\ntypically done in the `build.gradle` app file or, if you have one, in your `react.gradle` custom gradle file at app\nlevel.\n\n```groovy\nproject.ext.react = [\n  /// ...other options...\n  enableHermes: true\n]\n```\n\nThen we need to tell to ProGuard (if you're using it) to keep some Hermes classes.\n\n```java\n-keep class com.facebook.hermes.unicode.** { *; }\n```\n\nIn the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/hermes \"hermes react native setup\") these\nare all the step needed to activate Hermes. So we added these configurations to our apps and we launched our app, but we\ngot the following error.\n\n```shell\n2020-01-17 22:04:30.194 5745-6293/it.app E/SoLoader: couldn't find DSO to load: libhermes.so\n2020-01-17 22:04:30.646 5745-6293/it.app E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: create_react_context\n    Process: it.app, PID: 5745\n    java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: couldn't find DSO to load: libhermes.so\n        at com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader.doLoadLibraryBySoName(SoLoader.java:738)\n        at com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader.loadLibraryBySoName(SoLoader.java:591)\n        at com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader.loadLibrary(SoLoader.java:529)\n        at com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader.loadLibrary(SoLoader.java:484)\n        at com.facebook.hermes.reactexecutor.HermesExecutor.<clinit>(HermesExecutor.java:20)\n        at com.facebook.hermes.reactexecutor.HermesExecutorFactory.create(HermesExecutorFactory.java:27)\n        at com.facebook.react.ReactInstanceManager$5.run(ReactInstanceManager.java:952)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:761)\n```\n\nAs the error says, the compilation is failing because gradle is not able to find one the shared libraries used by\nHermes. If you think well we are also missing a part in our setup: we said that React Native contains a compiled version\nof Hermes, but we are not telling to gradle where it can pick the `aar` file that contains it. Let's fix this problem\nwith the help of the [React Native upgrade tool](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/).  \nFirst we need to add to the `repository` section in the main gradle file a new maven repository (that is contained in\nthe node_modules of the app).\n\n```groovy\n//....\n\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n      //....\n      maven { url(\"$rootDir/../node_modules/jsc-android/dist\") }\n      //....\n    }\n}\n\n//....\n```\n\nThen we need to declare the Hermes compiled version as dependencies in the `build.gradle` file.\n\n```groovy\n//...\n\ndebugImplementation files(\"../../node_modules/hermes-engine/android/hermes-debug.aar\")\nqaReleaseImplementation files(\"../../node_modules/hermes-engine/android/hermes-release.aar\")\nreleaseImplementation files(\"../../node_modules/hermes-engine/android/hermes-release.aar\")\n\n//...\n```\n\nAs you can see from above we needed to link the `aar` version of Hermes specifically for each build variant we have. We\nalso need to rename our `qa` flavor to `qaRelease` and link it to the `hermes-release.aar` file. Why? Because our QA\nbuild configuration inherits from the release one, and the **`react.gradle` contained in the React Native\nitself (`node_modules/react-native/react.gradle`)** does some checks based on the flavor name and, if it contains\nrelease, it performs some additional operations for apps with Hermes enabled related to the generation of the sourcemap\nand the removal of the debugger libraries (not needed for a release build). Below you can find the parts that do checks\non the variant name.\n\n```groovy\n//...\n\nif (enableHermes) {\n  doLast {\n    def hermesFlags;\n    def hbcTempFile = file(\"${jsBundleFile}.hbc\")\n    exec {\n      if (targetName.toLowerCase().contains(\"release\")) {\n        // Can't use ?: since that will also substitute valid empty lists\n        hermesFlags = config.hermesFlagsRelease\n        if (hermesFlags == null) hermesFlags = [\"-O\", \"-output-source-map\"]\n        } else {\n          hermesFlags = config.hermesFlagsDebug\n          if (hermesFlags == null) hermesFlags = []\n        }\n\n        if (Os.isFamily(Os.FAMILY_WINDOWS)) {\n          commandLine(\"cmd\", \"/c\", getHermesCommand(), \"-emit-binary\", \"-out\", hbcTempFile, jsBundleFile, *hermesFlags)\n      } else {\n        commandLine(getHermesCommand(), \"-emit-binary\", \"-out\", hbcTempFile, jsBundleFile, *hermesFlags)\n      }\n    }\n\n    //....\n  }\n}\n\n//...\ndef isRelease = targetName.toLowerCase().contains(\"release\")\ndef libDir = \"$buildDir/intermediates/transforms/\"\ndef vmSelectionAction = {\n    fileTree(libDir).matching {\n        if (enableHermes) {\n            // For Hermes, delete all the libjsc* files\n            include \"**/libjsc*.so\"\n\n            if (isRelease) {\n                // Reduce size by deleting the debugger/inspector\n                include '**/libhermes-inspector.so'\n                include '**/libhermes-executor-debug.so'\n            } else {\n                // Release libs take precedence and must be removed\n                // to allow debugging\n                include '**/libhermes-executor-release.so'\n            }\n        } else {\n            // For JSC, delete all the libhermes* files\n            include \"**/libhermes*.so\"\n        }\n    }.visit { details ->\n        def targetVariant = \".*/transforms/[^/]*/${targetPath}/.*\"\n        def path = details.file.getAbsolutePath().replace(File.separatorChar, '/' as char)\n        if (path.matches(targetVariant) && details.file.isFile()) {\n            details.file.delete()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nHermes is one of the cool new features contained in the new version of React Native :sunglasses:.

How can you\ncustomize their serialization/deserialization? Let's go to discover the power of Java Service Provider Interface.*\n\n--- \n\nIn the last weeks I started to work in a new team on a new project at [lm group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com \n\"lastminute\"). One of the goals we have is to renew the foundations of the company software overall architecture by introducing in the development workflow new technologies. In particular, we are using [Axon](https://www.axoniq.io), a framework to help developer to create [Domain Driven Design](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2021/06/06/ddd-dictionary/) applications that leverage specific architectural pattern like [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) and [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html).  \nDuring the definition of a new microservice we had to customize the object mapper used by Axon, \ndefined in one maven module (that will probably be integrated in our [app-framework framework](https://technology.lastminute.com/frontend-backend-languages-frameworks/) \nif we decide to stick with it) from one of our new app specific module *without creating any kind of \ncoupling/dependencies*. This is how me and [Alex Stabile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-stabile-a9316b94/) \ndiscovered the power of [Java Service Provider interface](https://www.baeldung.com/java-spi), used by [Jackson \nObject Mapper](https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-object-mapper-tutorial) to register external custom [Modules](https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.7/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/Module.html) in order \nto apply application specific serialization/deserialization procedures.  \nBefore starting with the implementation details, let me introduce Alex :rocket::clap:. He is a Senior Software \nEngineer with 9 years of experience. He is able to develop software application as a real Full stack developer, from \nthe backend using a lot of different languages, to the frontend (web and mobile).\nSo everything is setup and ready, let's go!! :rocket: \n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start by defining a simple `webapp` application defined in one maven module. This app exposes a couple of \nendpoints in the `ProductRestController`, a standard spring boot `RestController`. These endpoints let the client add \nand retrieve `Product` information by using the `ProductRepository`. Below you can find the controller code.\n\n```kotlin\n@RestController\nclass ProductRestController(\n    private val productRepository: ProductRepository\n) {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/product/{idProduct}\")\n    fun getProductFor(@PathVariable idProduct: Long): ResponseEntity<*> =\n        productRepository\n            .get(idProduct)\n            .fold(\n                { ResponseEntity.notFound().build() },\n                { ResponseEntity.ok(it) }\n            )\n\n    @PostMapping(\"/product/add\")\n    fun add(@RequestBody product: Product): ResponseEntity<*> =\n        productRepository\n            .add(product)\n            .fold(\n                { ResponseEntity.internalServerError().build() },\n                { ResponseEntity.ok(it) }\n            )\n}\n```\n\nThe `Product` and `ProductRepository` classes are really simple. `ProductRepository` is an [\"in memory \nrepository\"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InMemoryTestDatabase.html) that exposes a couple of methods to get and \nadd products. This repository has been created using [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io) (see the result type of type \n`Option`).\n\n```kotlin\nclass ProductRepository {\n    private val products = mutableListOf(\n        Product(\n            1,\n            \"A product\",\n            Money.of(BigDecimal(\"100.00\"), \"EUR\")\n        ),\n        Product(\n            2,\n            \"Another product\",\n            Money.of(BigDecimal(\"150.00\"), \"EUR\")\n        ),\n        Product(\n            3,\n            \"Yet another product\",\n            Money.of(BigDecimal(\"120.50\"), \"EUR\")\n        )\n    )\n\n    fun get(idProduct: Long): Option<Product> =\n        products.find { it.idProduct == idProduct }.toOption()\n\n    fun add(product: Product): Option<Unit> =\n        products\n            .find { it.idProduct == product.idProduct }\n            .toOption()\n            .fold(\n                {\n                    products.add(product)\n                    Unit.some()\n                },\n                { None }\n            )\n}\n```\n\n`Product` contains the information about our products. Here comes the interesting part: the `amount` property has \nbeen defined using the `Money` type from the [JavaMoney library](http://javamoney.github.io). \n\n```kotlin\nimport org.javamoney.moneta.Money\n\ndata class Product(\n    val idProduct: Long,\n    val description: String,\n    val amount: Money\n)\n```\n\nThe fact that we are using the `Money` type in the amount means that in the response and request of te endpoints we \nshowed above, the object to be passed as JSON should be with all the fields of this type. For example the \n`/product/{idProduct}` endpoint will return us the following response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"idProduct\": 3,\n  \"description\": \"Yet another product\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": {\n      \"context\": {\n        \"providerName\": \"java.util.Currency\",\n        \"empty\": false\n      },\n      \"currencyCode\": \"EUR\",\n      \"numericCode\": 978,\n      \"defaultFractionDigits\": 2\n    },\n    \"number\": 120.5,\n    \"context\": {\n      \"precision\": 256,\n      \"fixedScale\": false,\n      \"maxScale\": -1,\n      \"amountType\": \"org.javamoney.moneta.Money\",\n      \"providerName\": null,\n      \"empty\": false\n    },\n    \"numberStripped\": 120.5,\n    \"zero\": false,\n    \"positive\": true,\n    \"positiveOrZero\": true,\n    \"negative\": false,\n    \"negativeOrZero\": false,\n    \"factory\": {\n      \"defaultMonetaryContext\": {\n        \"precision\": 0,\n        \"fixedScale\": false,\n        \"maxScale\": 63,\n        \"amountType\": \"org.javamoney.moneta.Money\",\n        \"providerName\": null,\n        \"empty\": false\n      },\n      \"maxNumber\": null,\n      \"minNumber\": null,\n      \"amountType\": \"org.javamoney.moneta.Money\",\n      \"maximalMonetaryContext\": {\n        \"precision\": 0,\n        \"fixedScale\": false,\n        \"maxScale\": -1,\n        \"amountType\": \"org.javamoney.moneta.Money\",\n        \"providerName\": null,\n        \"empty\": false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is not what we want!!! :fearful:  What we would like to have as response is something like the following json. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"idProduct\": 3,\n  \"description\": \"Yet another product\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"amount\": \"120.5\",\n    \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe also have the same problem in the `/product/add` endpoint, where we are forced to send a request with the payload \nabove, the one with all the `Money` fields, in order to add a product. How can we customize the way the Jackson \n`ObjectMapper` serialize/deserialize `Money` instances? We can write a custom `Module` for it. By \ndefining a custom module we can add ad-hoc serializers and deserializers. We will define our object mapper module in \na *new maven module* called `money-module`.  \nLet's start by defining the`MoneyDeserializer`. It will give us the ability to define a `Money` instance from the data \ncontained in a JSON that we are deserializing.\n\n```kotlin\nopen class MoneyDeserializer : StdDeserializer<Money>(Money::class.java) {\n    override fun deserialize(jsonParser: JsonParser, obj: DeserializationContext): Money {\n        val node: JsonNode = jsonParser.codec.readTree(jsonParser)\n        val amount = BigDecimal(node.get(\"value\").asText())\n        val currency: String = node.get(\"currency\").asText()\n\n        return Money.of(amount, currency)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `MoneySerializer` let us defined which fields of a `Money` instance we want to write to a json. We can also the \ndefine the specific type we want to use in the json for each one of them.\n\n```kotlin\nopen class MoneySerializer : StdSerializer<Money>(Money::class.java) {\n    @Throws(IOException::class)\n    override fun serialize(money: Money, jsonGenerator: JsonGenerator, serializerProvider: SerializerProvider) {\n        jsonGenerator.writeStartObject()\n        jsonGenerator.writeStringField(\"amount\", money.numberStripped.toPlainString())\n        jsonGenerator.writeStringField(\"currency\", money.currency.toString())\n        jsonGenerator.writeEndObject()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we can add our custom serializer/deserializer to our `MoneyModule` definition. \n\n```kotlin\nclass MoneyModule: SimpleModule() {\n    override fun getModuleName(): String = this.javaClass.simpleName\n\n    override fun setupModule(context: SetupContext) {\n        val serializers = SimpleSerializers()\n        serializers.addSerializer(Money::class.java, MoneySerializer())\n        context.addSerializers(serializers)\n\n        val deserializers = SimpleDeserializers()\n        deserializers.addDeserializer(Money::class.java, MoneyDeserializer())\n        context.addDeserializers(deserializers)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe are now at the core of our development: how do we load our custom module into our object mapper? Well we have \ndifferent options based on our use case. If you're using the *DEFAULT Spring Boot object mapper* you can just *define \na new `@Bean` for the `MoneyModule`* that will be used by Spring Boot to load it(with its custom internal flow).  \nBut this is not our case: in our `ProductConfiguration` we have defined a custom `objectMapper` bean.\n\n```kotlin\n@Configuration\nclass ProductConfiguration {\n    @Bean\n    fun productRepository(): ProductRepository = ProductRepository()\n\n    @Bean\n    @Primary\n    fun objectMapper(): ObjectMapper =\n        ObjectMapper()\n            .findAndRegisterModules()\n            .configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false)\n}\n```\n\nIf you look closely to our `ObjectMapper` definition you can see something interesting: before returning the \ninstance creation there is a call to the `findAndRegisterModules`. What does this method do? It contains \nthe core feature of Jackson `Module`s load :heart_eyes:. This method is in charge of loading external third party \nmodules using the [Java Service Provider interfaces](https://www.baeldung.com/java-spi).  \nThis is a feature of Java 6 that let (library) developer write code to load and discovery third party plugins for their \nlibrary implementations that matches a specific interface. In our case Jackson uses it to load every third party \nimplementation that matches the `Module` interface. How does it work? The `ServiceProvider` will scan the classpath \nsearching for service definition adhering to the base interface defined for the external/third party implementation.  \nThis is done by searching for a specific file in the folders `META-INF/services` of the (maven) modules in the classpath, named with \nthe fully qualified name of the interface loaded by the `ServiceProvider` and that contains the fully qualified name \nof our implementation. So in our case, to load our `MoneyModule` contained in the maven module `money-module`, we \njust have to add a file named `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module` in  the `META-INF/services` folder of the \n`money-module` and inside it write the fully qualified name of our `MoneyModule` implementation.\n\n![contract testing pact](../images/posts/module-jackson.jpg \"custom module jackson findAndRegisterModules\")\n\nThat's it!!! :rocket: With the implementation above we have a custom Jackson `Module` that will be loaded by its \n`ObjectMapper` automatically without creating any dependencies. In this way you will be able to publish your \ncustom serializer/deserializer as custom maven artifacts and use them in all your projects (without copy/paste them)\n:heart:.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find the complete source code of the example show above in this [Github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Custom-Jackson-Module).

PBR is \"everywhere\"\nin computer graphics. But wait, what is it PBR :fearful:? PBR uses physically correct lighting and shading models to\ntreat light as it behaves in the real world. As a consequence of the fact that what could be seen in a computer graphics\napplication is decided by how light is represented, with PBR it is possible to reach a new level of realism. Wait,\nwhat do we mean with \"physically correct\"?  \nBefore giving an answer and try to give a detail definition of PBR we need to understand well some important concepts.\n\n#### **What is light?**\n\nLight is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Specifically, it is a small subset of the entire electromagnetic radiation\nspectrum with wavelength between 400 nm and 700 nm. The set of studies and techniques that try to describe and measure\nhow the electromagnetic radiation of light is propagated, reflected and transmitted is called radiometry. What are the\nfundamental quantities described by radiometry? The first one is the called **flux**, it describes the amount of radiant\nenergy emitted, reflected or transmitted from a surface per unit time. The radiant energy is the energy of an\nelectromagnetic radiation. The unit measure of flux is joules per seconds $\\frac{J}{s}$, and it is usually reported with\nthe Greek letter $\\phi$.  \nOther two important quantities of radiometry are **irradiance** and **radiant exitance**. The first one described flux\narriving at a surface per unit area. The second one describe flux leaving a surface per unit area (Pharr et al.,\n2010 [1]). Formally irradiance is described with the following equation:\n\n$$\nE = \\frac{d\\phi}{dA}\n$$\n\nwhere the differential flux $d\\phi$ is computed over the differential area $dA$. It is measured as units of watt per\nsquare meter.  \nBefore proceeding to the last radiometry quantity definition, it is useful to give the definition of **solid angle**. A\nsolid angle is an extension of a 2D angle in 3D on a unit sphere. It is the total area projected by an object on a unit\nsphere centered at a point $p$. It is measured in steradians. The entire unit sphere corresponds to a solid angle of\n$4\\pi$ (the surface area of the unit sphere). A solid angle is usually indicated as $\\Omega$, but it is possible also to\nrepresent it with $\\omega$, that is the set of all direction vectors anchored at $p$ that point toward the area on the\nunit sphere and the object (Pharr et al., 2010 [1]). Now it is possible to give the definition of **radiance**, that is\nflux density per unit solid angle per unit area:\n\n$$\nL=\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\omega \\ dA^{\\perp}}\n$$\n\nIn this case $dA^{\\perp}$ is the projected area $dA$ on a surface perpendicular to $\\omega$. So radiance describe the\nlimit of measurement of incident light at the surface as a cone of incident directions of interest ${d\\omega}$ becomes\nvery small, and as the local area of interest on the surface $dA$ also becomes very small (Pharr et al., 2010 [1]). It\nis useful to make a distinction between radiance arriving at a point, usually called incident radiance and indicated\nwith $L_{i}(p,\\omega)$, and radiance leaving a point called exitant radiance and indicated with $L_{o}(p,\\omega)$. This\ndistinction will be used in the equations described below. It is important also to note another useful property, that\nconnect the two types of radiance:\n\n$$\nL_{i}(p,\\omega) \\neq L_{o}(p,\\omega)\n$$\n\n#### **The rendering equation**\n\nThe rendering equation was introduced by James Kajiya in 1986 [2]. Sometimes it is also called the LTE, Light Transport\nEquation. It is the equation that describes the equilibrium distribution of radiance in a scene (Pharr et al., 2010 [3])\n. It gives the total reflected radiance at a point as a sum of emitted and reflected light from a surface. This is the\nformula of the rendering equation:\n\n$$\nL_{o}(p,\\omega) = L_{e}(p,\\omega) + \\int_{\\Omega}f_{r}(p,\\omega_{i},\\omega_{0})L_{i}(p,\\omega)\\cos\\theta_{i}d\\omega_\n{i}\n$$\n\nIn this formula the meaning of each symbol are:\n\n* $p$ is a point on a surface in the scene\n* $\\omega_{o}$ is the outgoing light direction\n* $\\omega_{i}$ is the incident light direction\n* $L_{o}(p,\\omega)$ is the exitant radiance at a point $p$\n* $L_{e}(p,\\omega)$ is the emitted radiance at a point $p$\n* $\\Omega$ is the unit hemisphere centered around the normal at point $p$\n* $\\int_{\\Omega}...d\\omega_{i}$ is the integral over the unit hemisphere\n* $f_{r}(p,\\omega_{i},\\omega_{0})$ is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and we will talk about it in a\n  few moments\n* $L_{i}(p,\\omega)$ is the incident radiance arriving at a point $p$\n* $\\cos\\theta_{i}$ is given by the dot product between 𝜔: and the normal at point $p$, and is the attenuation factor of\n  the irradiance due to incident angle\n\n#### **BRDF**\n\nOne of the main component of the rendering equation previously described is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution\nFunction (BRDF). This function describes how light is reflected from a surface. It represents a constant of\nproportionality between the differential exitant radiance and the differential irradiance at a point $p$ (Pharr et al.,\n2010 [1]). The parameter of this function are: the incident light direction, the outgoing light direction and a point on\nthe surface. The formula for this function in terms of radiometric quantities is the following:\n\n$$\nf_{r}(p,\\omega_{i},\\omega_{o}) = \\frac{dL_{o}(p,\\omega_{o})}{dE(p,\\omega_{I})}\n$$\n\nThe BRDF has two important properties:\n\n* it is a symmetric function, so for all pair of directions $f_{r}(p,\\omega_{i},\\omega_{o}) = f_{r}(p,\\omega_\n  {o},\\omega_{i})$\n* it satisfies the **energy conservation principle**: *the light reflected is less than or equal to the incident light*.\n\nA lot of models has been developed to describe the BRDF of different surfaces. In particular, in the last years the **microfacet** \nmodels have gained attention. In these kind of models the surface is represented as composed by infinitely\nsmall microfacets that model in a more realistic way the vast majority of surfaces in the real world. Each one of these\nmicrofacets has is geometric definition (in particular its normal).  \nSome specific material surfaces, for example glass, reflect and transmit light at the same time. So a fraction of light\ngoes through the material. For this reason, there’s another function, the Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution\nFunction, BTDF, defined in the same way as the BRDF, but with the directions $\\omega_{i}$ and $\\omega_{o}$ placed in the\nopposite hemisphere around $p$ (Pharr et al., 2010 [1]). It is usually indicated as $f_{t}(p,\\omega_{i},\\omega_{o})$.\nThe **[Fresnel equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations \"Fresnel equations\")** tries to define the\nbehaviour of light between different surfaces. They also help us to get the balance between different kind of\nreflections changes based on the angle at which you view the surface.\n\n#### **Physically Based Rendering**\n\nSo let's go back to our original question: What is PBR? PBR is a model that enclose a set of techniques that try to\nsimulate how the light behaves in the real world. Taking an extraction from the Wikipedia definition:\n\n> PBR is often characterized by an approximation of a real, radiometric bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to govern the essential reflections of light, the use of reflection constants such as specular intensity, gloss, and metallicity derived from measurements of real-world sources, accurate modeling of global illumination in which light bounces and/or is emitted from objects other than the primary light sources, conservation of energy which balances the intensity of specular highlights with dark areas of an object, Fresnel conditions that reflect light at the sides of objects perpendicular to the viewer, and accurate modeling of roughness resulting from microsurfaces.\n\nYou can see from the definition that PBR is a model that uses all the concepts we saw previously in this article to try\nto get the most accurate results in terms of realism in a computer graphics applications. PBR engines and asset\npipelines let the artist define materials in terms of more realistic components, instead of tweaking ad-hoc parameters\nbased on the type of the surface. Usually in these kind of engine/assets pipeline the main parameter used to specify a\nsurface features are:\n\n* albedo/diffuse: this component controls the base color/reflectivity of the surface\n* metallic: this component specifies the is the surface is metallic or not\n* roughness: this component specifies how rough a surface is on a per texel basis\n* normal: this component is a classical normal map of the surface\n\nWhat results can you achieve suing PBR? These are two example images: the first one is taken from my physically based\nspectral path tracing\nengine [Spectral Clara Lux Tracer](https://github.com/chicio/Spectral-Clara-Lux-Tracer \"Spectral Clara Lux Tracer\") and\nthe second one is taken from PBRT, the physically based engine described in the\nbook [\"Physically based rendering: from theory to implementation\" by M.

Let’s find out in this new post.*\n\n--- \n\nIn the last year I migrated this blog on [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com). This basically means that now this blog is powered by [React, a framework I love](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/). In particular, I used only [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html \"react hooks\") and functional components. One of the thing I had to do was to detect the scroll direction in order to implement the sticky header with hide on scroll feature that you can find at the top of this page (and everywhere on this website). How can we do this? Searching on the web I found this [well written post on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62497110/detect-scroll-direction-in-react-js \"react scroll detection\") that contains a raw implementation of what I needed. In this blog post I will show you how I evolved that react hook into into a production ready one that you can use to detect the scroll direction in a page.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet’s start from defining an enum that will represent the scroll direction. Let’s define it as string, because you know that [enums in typescript are dangerous if you don’t define explicit values](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-05-27-the-dangers-of-typescript-enums/ \"enum typescript danger\") :bomb:. \n\n```typescript\nexport enum ScrollDirection {\n  up = “up”,\n  down = “down”,\n}\n```\n\nNow we can start to create our hook. We will define it as `useScrollDirection`  function and we will define two thing:\n\n* a `threshold` variable that will be use as threshold: we will detect change in the scroll direction if the user scrolls for at least `100`  pixels up or down\n* a `scrollDir` react state defined with the `useState`  hook that will store the current scroll direction. This is what we will return as result from our hook.\n\nAfter this we will use the `useEffect` hooks, an hook used to [perform side effects in functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html \"react hook effect\"). Inside it we will define all the scroll detection logic. The `useEffect` hook is invoked without dependencies (the empty array `[]` passed as second parameter). As you may already know this basically means that its behavior will be equivalent to the `componentDidMount`  react class component lifecycle method. This is what we came up so far.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport enum ScrollDirection {\n  up = “up”,\n  down = “down”,\n}\n\nexport const useScrollDirection = () => {\n  const threshold = 100;\n  const [scrollDir, setScrollDir] = useState(ScrollDirection.up);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // …scroll detection logic\n  }, []);\n\n  return scrollDir;\n};\n```\n\nNow we are ready to write our scroll detection logic. The first thing to do is to save the initial Y scroll position of the window when we execute the hook. We will store in the `previousScrollYPosition` variable. Then we will write some functions:\n\n* `scrolledMoreThanThreshold` is a function that will detect is the user scroll more pixel than the ones defined in the `threshold` variable we defined before. To do this it will basically check that the absolute difference (no sign) between the  `previousScrollYPosition` and the current scroll position received as parameter is greater than `threshold`\n* `isScrollingUp` is one of the two core function needed in order to detect the scroll direction. It basically check if the current scroll position is greater that the previous scroll position. We need also to define some **additional checks** needed in order to **to avoid to receive false positive scroll direction** (they will basically avoid scroll direction updates if the user is at the top/bottom of the page and it continues to scroll).\n* `updateScrollDirection` is the other core function. It basically uses the previous defined functions to check if the user is scrolling more that the threshold and the scroll direction (using the `isScrollingUp`  function). It then update the `scrollDir`  state and the `previousScrollYPosition` variable if a scroll change has been detected.\n* `onScroll`  is a function that attaches the  `updateScrollDirection` function to the `window.requestAnimationFrame` function so that we can calculate our scroll direction in sync with the window refresh frame rate (so if you have a refresh of 60 fps you will receive 60 calls per seconds). In this way we will be sure that our scroll direction calculation will happen after each page render/repaint.\n\nNow we have all the functions we need in order to detect the scroll direction. \nThe last thing we need to do is to attach the `onScroll` function to the scroll listener with the `window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", onScroll);` instruction.\nWait…how do we clean/remove the listener? 🤔 Well, the `useEffect` hooks can return a function that will be used to cleanup every resource used in the hook when the component that launched it will be unmounted. \nSo the (real 🙇) last thing we need to do is to return the clean up function that will basically call  `window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", onScroll)`  to remove the listener.\nThat’s it!!! 🚀🚀🚀 Below you can find the complete hook that you can copy/paste in your application. If you want you can try to go further by parametrizing some of the vaues used inside the hook (eg.: threshold)\n\n```typescript \nimport { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport enum ScrollDirection {\n  up = “up”,\n  down = “down”,\n}\n\nexport const useScrollDirection = () => {\n  const threshold = 100;\n  const [scrollDir, setScrollDir] = useState(ScrollDirection.up);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let previousScrollYPosition = window.scrollY;\n\n    const scrolledMoreThanThreshold = (currentScrollYPosition: number) =>\n      Math.abs(currentScrollYPosition - previousScrollYPosition) > threshold;\n\n    const isScrollingUp = (currentScrollYPosition: number) =>\n      currentScrollYPosition > previousScrollYPosition &&\n      !(previousScrollYPosition > 0 && currentScrollYPosition === 0) &&\n      !(currentScrollYPosition > 0 && previousScrollYPosition === 0);\n\n    const updateScrollDirection = () => {\n      const currentScrollYPosition = window.scrollY;\n\n      if (scrolledMoreThanThreshold(currentScrollYPosition)) {\n        const newScrollDirection = isScrollingUp(currentScrollYPosition)\n          ? ScrollDirection.down\n          : ScrollDirection.up;\n        setScrollDir(newScrollDirection);\n        previousScrollYPosition =\n          currentScrollYPosition > 0 ? currentScrollYPosition : 0;\n      }\n    };\n\n    const onScroll = () => window.requestAnimationFrame(updateScrollDirection);\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", onScroll);\n\n    return () => window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", onScroll);\n  }, []);\n\n  return scrollDir;\n};\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nDid you enjoy reading my post?

The Text component has everything we need to create some sort of 'attributed text' directly in SwiftUI. Let's go!!!*\n\n---\n\nIn some recent posts (have a look [here](https://technology.lastminute.com/widget-ios-swiftui-configuration-intent/ \"swiftui widget friyay lastminute\") and [here](https://technology.lastminute.com/widget-ios-swiftui-react-native/ \"swiftui widget lastminute\") ) we show a beautfiul project me and Marco are creating during our [Friyay at lastminute.com](https://technology.lastminute.com/tech-learning-and-development-friyay/ \"lastminute.com friyay\"): some widgets for our iOS apps.\nFor the second widget we developed, one that will show to our users their bookings information, we faced a challenge to display the information of hotels.  \nOur mobile app designer [Rafael de Sena Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raffaelmartinez/ \"Rafael Martinez \nlastminute.com\") asked us to display the hotel name and the hotel rating as if it was a single text, with the rating \nrepresented by a number of stars matching the rating itself.\n\n![The layout of the hotel widget](../images/posts/swiftui-hotel-layout.png)\n\nFrom iOS 15 the `Text` supports the new `AttributedString` from the `Foundation` framework as a parameter. But... given that the ne AttributedString are not always [easy to use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75513158/how-do-you-add-an-image-attachment-to-an-attributedstring) and we wanted a more \"SwiftUI native\" way to create our custom text, we wondered if there was another way to do our implementation.  \nLuckily we discovered that in SwiftUI the `+` is overloaded and does some incredible magic :crystal_ball:. It \nbasically concatenates each `Text` content while keeping each own specific formatting :scream:. It's like having \nAttributed Strings directly implemented in SwiftUI :rocket:.  \nAfter this discovery, we were ready to implement our own custom layout above. So let's no longer wait and jump into the implementation right now!!! :rocket:\n\n\n#### Implementation\n\nAll our texts uses a custom font called [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu \"ubuntu font\"), so first we had to find a way to apply this custom font to all the `Text` views in our code in a smart way (without reappying the entire `font` modifier every time).  \nThe overloaded `+` operator we discussed in the introduction is targeted on `Text` instances. This means that:\n\n* if we create a custom modifier to apply the custom font, it should return a `Text` instance and not the opaque data type `some View`\n* all the standard SwiftUI modifier applied to the concatenated `Text`s should be the one that return again `Text` instance, not the opaque data type `some View`\n\nThis is why we decided to create an extension of `Text` that applies our custom font.\n\n```swift\nenum TextWeight: String {\n  case normal = \"Ubuntu-Regular\"\n  case bold = \"Ubuntu-Bold\"\n}\n\nextension Text {\n  func ubuntu(\n    size: Double = 14.0,\n    color: Color = Color(\"TextColorGray\"),\n    weight: TextWeight = TextWeight.normal\n  ) -> Text {\n    self\n      .font(Font.custom(weight.rawValue, size: size))\n      .foregroundColor(color)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow we were ready to create our custom layout. In order to create it we needed to create a new SwiftUI view that contains the name and the ratings stars. We named it `HotelNameWithStars`. This new view receive as parameters:\n\n* the name of the hotel as a `String`\n* the rating of the hotel as an `Int`\n\nObviously the text is separated in 2 parts: \n\n* the name, a dark grey text with font size 14 and font weight bold\n* the rating stars, a yellow sequence of stars icons with font size 14\n\nFor the name, it was easy, we just create a Text instance that contains the hotel name and a space (to separate it from the stars). We put it in a function named `formattedName`.\n\n``` swift\n  //... other code\n\n  private func formattedName() -> Text {\n    return Text(\"\\(name) \").ubuntu(size: 14.0, weight: TextWeight.bold)\n  }\n\n  //... other code\n```\n\nFor the stars it was a little bit trickier. We needed to generate a text that contains a number of stars matching the rating. The star itself was a custom image in our bundle assets. We basically needed to \"loop over the rating\" and generate an instance of `Text`containing the yellow stars. Which is in functional programming the high order function that given a sequence of data structure and a combining operationg gives you a return value of a new type? Reduce :heart:.\nSo what we did:\n\n* we created a `Range` data structure using the rating as upper bound\n* we applied reduce to this range, combining the current accumulated stars as text with a new one, to which we applied also the custom formatting described above.\n\n``` swift\n  //... other code\n\n  private func formattedStars() -> Text {\n    return (0..<rating).reduce(Text(\"\")) { toBeDisplayed, _ in\n      toBeDisplayed + Text(Image(\"icon_star\")).foregroundColor(Color.yellow).ubuntu(size: 14.0)\n    }\n  }\n\n  //... other code\n```\n\nNow we were ready to combine all our `Text`s together. Obviously after combining multiple `Text`s, you can apply additional modifiers to obtained text. These modifier will be applied to the entire string content. In our case we needed to set the `lineLimit` to 3 and the `lineSpacing`.\nWe also have an addition `fixedSize` modifier that we need to tell to the component where this will be used that the text should not be truncated vertical.  \nThat's it. Below you can find the complete implementation.\n\n\n```swift\nfileprivate struct HotelNameWithStars: View {\n  let name: String\n  let rating: Int\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    (formattedName() + formattedStars())\n    .lineLimit(3)\n    .lineSpacing(3)\n    .fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)\n  }\n  \n  private func formattedName() -> Text {\n    return Text(\"\\(name) \").ubuntu(size: 14.0, weight: TextWeight.bold)\n  }\n  \n  private func formattedStars() -> Text {\n    return (0..<rating).reduce(Text(\"\")) { toBeDisplayed, _ in\n      toBeDisplayed + Text(Image(\"icon_star\")).foregroundColor(Color.yellow).ubuntu(size: 14.0)\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWe love SwiftUI :heart:. With every release Apple is making the app developer life easier than ever :rocket:. Also with the new additions during WWDC23, SwiftData and Macro above all, developers will have some fun in the near future :rocket:. Sooo stay tuned, our new widget where we implemented the custom layout above is going to be released very soon!!! :rocket:\n","slug":"/2023/06/30/swiftui-text-concatenation/","description":"Do you need a way to compose beautiful text with images and custom font like you are used with  Attributed String.

Is it possible to load chunks of JavaScript code only when they are really needed? Yes you can with\nWebpack and its code splitting feature based on a syntax equal to the one of ES2020 dynamic imports.*\n\n---\n\nRecently I migrated my website (this one you're seeing right now) to TypeScript + Webpack as bundling system. One of the\nmain problem of my website was the dimension of the final JavaScript generated after the bundling for\nthe [homepage](/ \"fabrizio duroni home\"). As a consequence of the fact that this page contains a Threejs physically\nbased scene, the size of the `index.home.js` script was over 600 KB :scream:. This was too much, considering also that\nall this JavaScript was loaded without been used on the mobile version of the website, where this feature was turned\noff.  \nDuring the last few months of my daily job at lastminute.com I worked on a project that is using Webpack for bundling\nthe JS code. In particular, during the development of a new part of the user personal area I encountered the code\nsplitting with lazy loading feature of Webpack and immediately I thought: \"THIS IS WHAT I NEED FOR THE HOMEPAGE OF\nfabrizioduroni.it\". :heart_eyes:  \nSo let's start and see how I used it on my website so that you can start to optimize your site too!!\n\n#### Implementation\n\nFirst of all, there are two types of output file generated by Webpack:\n\n- entry files, that are the one main entry points for your application. This are usually the files that you will add\n  with a script tag in your HTML pages (or you can let Webpack add them automatically, but this is a story for another\n  post :smirk:)\n- chunk files, that are the one obtained after the code splitting\n\nIn a base Webpack configuration file it is usually contained the `entry` property that contains the list of entry files\nto be bundled. To enable code splitting and chunk files generation we need to add a new entry in the configuration\ncalled `chunkFilename`. With this configuration entry we can tell Webpack how to name the chunks file generated. In my\ncase I defined the name as a concatenation of some Webpack built-in environment variable:\n\n- `[name]`, the chunk name\n- `[chunkhash]`, the hash generated by Webpack from the content of the chunk. If its content is changed than\n  the `chunkhash` will be updated consequently. It is similar to the `[hash]` variable used in the `entry`\n  configuration (but this one is generated from the entire build result).\n\n```diff\n{\n  mode: 'production',\n  entry: {\n    'index.home': 'ts/index.home.ts',\n    'index.blog': 'ts/index.blog.ts',\n  },\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].[hash].min.js',\n+    chunkFilename: '[name].[chunkhash].bundle.js',\n    publicPath: `dist/`,\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, dist),\n  },\n  module: {\n    /*...modules configurations...*/\n  },\n  /*...other configurations...*/\n}\n```\n\nSo now we have one thing left to do: decided what in our codebase will become a chunk in the final build. To do this,\nWebpack leverage the [ES2020 dynamic import syntax](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). In fact, all we\nneed to do is to import asynchronously the module we want to load later and execute it as soon as it loaded. In my\nspecific case I wanted to load the module `scene-threejs` only if some condition where respect:\n\n- the browser of the user supports WebGL (because it gives the best performance when compared to canvas drawing)\n- the device of the user is a computer/laptop (because I want to avoid too much mobile data usage and bad user\n  experience on some older devices)\n\nTo do this I added an async import with the\ndeclaration `import(/* webpackChunkName: \"scene-threejs\" */ './scene-threejs').then(module => module.sceneThreeJS())`.\nIn the `resolve` callback of the `then` method the loaded module is returned. In this case the `scene-threejs` contains\njust one exported function `sceneThreeJS`, that I execute as soon as the module is available. One important thing to\nnote is the `webpackChunkName` comment with value `\"scene-threejs\"`: this string will be assigned to the `[name]`\nWebpack environment variable and will be used as first part in the chunk file name (see the Webpack configuration\ndiscussed above). Below you can find the entire code, written using TypeScript (don't be scared by the types :laughing:)\n.\n\n```typescript\n/* ...other code... */\n\nconst isWebGLEnabled = (): boolean => {\n  /*...implementation...*/\n}\n\nconst scene3D = (): void => {\n  if (isWebGLEnabled() && !isAMobileDevice()) {\n    import(/* webpackChunkName: \"scene-threejs\" */ './scene-threejs').then(module => module.sceneThreeJS())\n  }\n}\n\nexport { scene3D }\n```\n\nThis is all I need to code split my codebase and lazy load modules only when they are needed. Let's see the code above\nin action. If I try to access the homepage of this website from a desktop/laptop computer I will see the threejs scene\nand in the network inspector the `scene-threejs` chunk is loaded. On important thing to note is that Webpack has created\ntwo chunk. One is our module (the one with the name `scene-threejs`). The second one that starts with the `vendor`\nkeyword contains all the third party dependencies.

This carousel stands out for its stunning parallax animation.\nEssentially, as you scroll through the images of TV shows/movies, the images shift based on the scroll position,\nadding a dynamic sense of motion to the entire experience. \nIn our apps we have been using [React Native](/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/) for quite some \ntime, but animations often have a bad reputation within this framework.\nLuca challenged the team, asking: “Do you think it’s possible to implement such a cool animation on our daily deals carousel? ChatGPT says it should be possible!”\nI took this challenge personally because I’m passionate about animations—a natural consequence of my love for \n[computer graphics](/2017/08/25/how-to-calculate-reflection-vector/)).\nAnd here I am today, having successfully implemented the challenge and enhanced our daily deals carousel with this \nnew, beautiful parallax effect.  \nIn this post, I’ll show you how to create a stunning full-screen circular carousel (that you can scroll endlessly) \nwith a parallax effect on the images and an opacity animation for the text descriptions of each item. Below, you can \nfind a video of the final result. \n\n`youtube: https://youtu.be/ECjX8bXVXzU`\n\nTo develop this carousel we will use:\n\n* Expo\n* React Native Reanimated\n* Expo Linear Gradient\n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start from the implementation of the main carousel component, `ParallaxCarousel`.\nThis component is a `Animated.FlatList` responsible for displaying the items and managing the scroll.\nIn particular, it has the responsibility to simulate the circular endless loop during the scroll.\n\n```tsx\nimport {FC} from 'react';\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\nimport {ParallaxCarouselItemData} from \"@/parallax-carousel/parallax-carousel-item/parallax-carousel-item-data\";\nimport {ParallaxCarouselItem} from \"@/parallax-carousel/parallax-carousel-item/parallax-carousel-item\";\nimport {useCircularCarousel} from \"@/parallax-carousel/use-circular-carousel\";\n\nexport const ParallaxCarousel: FC<{ items: ParallaxCarouselItemData[] }> = ({ items }) => {\n    const {\n        scrollX,\n        flatListRef,\n        itemsWithFakeEntries,\n        scrollHandler,\n        getItemLayout\n    } = useCircularCarousel(items);\n\n    return (\n        <Animated.FlatList\n            ref={flatListRef}\n            data={itemsWithFakeEntries}\n            keyExtractor={(item, index) => `${item.id}-${index}`}\n            horizontal\n            showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}\n            decelerationRate=\"normal\"\n            onScroll={scrollHandler}\n            scrollEventThrottle={16}\n            renderItem={({item, index}: { item: ParallaxCarouselItemData, index: number }) =>\n                <ParallaxCarouselItem index={index} scrollX={scrollX} item={item}/>}\n            pagingEnabled\n            initialScrollIndex={1}\n            getItemLayout={getItemLayout}\n            bounces={false}\n        />\n    );\n};\n```\n\nHow can we do this? From the staring array of `ParallaxCarouselItemData`, we generate a new one where **we add fake \nentries**:\n\n* one element at the beginning of the array, that is a copy of the last element that you can \n  find in \n  the original array.\n* one element at the end of the array, that is a copy of the first item in the original array\n\nThis new array will be the one used as data source by the `Animated.FlatList`.\nNow we can implement a `scrollHandler` using `useAnimatedScrollHandler`, where we put in place a logic for which \nwhen we reach one of these fake entries we added above, we **scroll without animation** to the corresponding real item.\nOn top of the circular loop logic we also need to store the `scrollX` offset position into a Reanimated `SharedValue`.\nWe will use it to implement the parallax and opacity animations.\n\nOne final note: to avoid calculation about where we need to \"force scroll\", we are using the `scrollToIndex` method \nof `FlatList`. This requires implementing also the `getItemLayout` callback for the flatList that gives the ability to the FlatList \nto cache in some way the offset of each item (and perform very fast the `scrolltoIndex` operation).  \n\n```tsx\nimport {ParallaxCarouselItemData} from \"@/parallax-carousel/parallax-carousel-item/parallax-carousel-item-data\";\nimport Animated, {runOnJS, useAnimatedRef, useAnimatedScrollHandler, useSharedValue} from \"react-native-reanimated\";\nimport {useMemo} from \"react\";\nimport {Dimensions} from \"react-native\";\n\nconst { width } = Dimensions.get('window');\n\nexport const useCircularCarousel = (items: ParallaxCarouselItemData[]) => {\n    const scrollX = useSharedValue(0);\n    const flatListRef = useAnimatedRef<Animated.FlatList<ParallaxCarouselItemData>>();\n    const itemsWithFakeEntries = useMemo(\n        () => [items[items.length - 1], ...items, items[0]],\n        [items]\n    );\n\n    const scrollToIndex = (index: number) => {\n        flatListRef.current?.scrollToIndex({ index: index, animated: false });\n    };\n\n    const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({\n        onScroll: (event) => {\n            scrollX.value = event.contentOffset.x;\n        },\n        onMomentumEnd: event => {\n            const index = Math.round(event.contentOffset.x / width);\n\n            if (index < 1) {\n                runOnJS(scrollToIndex)(items.length);\n            } else if (index > items.length) {\n                runOnJS(scrollToIndex)(1);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    const getItemLayout= (_: ArrayLike<ParallaxCarouselItemData> | null | undefined, index: number) =>\n        ({ length: width, offset: width * index, index })\n\n    return {\n        scrollX,\n        flatListRef,\n        itemsWithFakeEntries,\n        scrollHandler,\n        getItemLayout\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow that we have our carousel in `FlatList` iin place, we can implement the `ParallaxCarouselItem` component. This \ncomponent receive the `scrollX` offset from the parent, and pass it to the `useParallaxWithOpacityAnimations` hook \nto calculate the animation needed.\nIn terms strictly of UI, the component is quite straight forward.\nIt has an image fullscreen, wrapped by a `Animated.View` that we will use to apply the parallax animation.\nA `LinearGradient` is used to add som contrast with the texts at the bottom of the item, created using `Animated.\nText` views.  \n\n```tsx\nimport Animated, {SharedValue} from \"react-native-reanimated\";\nimport {Dimensions, Image, StyleSheet, View} from \"react-native\";\nimport {ParallaxCarouselItemData} from \"@/parallax-carousel/parallax-carousel-item/parallax-carousel-item-data\";\nimport {LinearGradient} from 'expo-linear-gradient';\nimport {\n    useParallaxWithOpacityAnimations\n} from \"@/parallax-carousel/parallax-carousel-item/use-parallax-with-opacity-animations\";\n\nconst { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');\n\nexport const ParallaxCarouselItem: FC<{ index: number, scrollX: SharedValue<number>; item: ParallaxCarouselItemData }> = ({ index, scrollX, item }) => {\n    const {parallaxAnimatedStyle, opacityAnimatedStyle} = useParallaxWithOpacityAnimations(index, scrollX, width);\n\n    return (\n        <View style={styles.itemContainer}>\n            <Animated.View style={[styles.imageContainer, parallaxAnimatedStyle]}>\n                <Image source={{ uri: item.image }} style={styles.image} />\n            </Animated.View>\n            <LinearGradient\n                style={styles.gradient}\n                start={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}\n                end={{ x: 0, y: 1 }}\n                colors={['#00000000', '#000000CC']}\n            >\n                <View style={styles.caption}>\n                    <Animated.Text style={[opacityAnimatedStyle, styles.title]}>{item.title}</Animated.Text>\n                    <Animated.Text style={[opacityAnimatedStyle, styles.description]}>{item.description}</Animated.Text>\n                </View>\n            </LinearGradient>\n        </View>\n    );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    itemContainer: {\n        width: width,\n        justifyContent: 'center',\n        alignItems: 'center',\n        overflow: 'hidden',\n    },\n    imageContainer: {\n        width: width,\n        height: height,\n        overflow: 'hidden',\n        position: 'absolute',\n    },\n    image: {\n        width: '100%',\n        height: '100%',\n        resizeMode: 'cover',\n    },\n    caption: {\n        paddingHorizontal: 24,\n        position: \"absolute\",\n        bottom: 60,\n        display: \"flex\",\n        flexDirection: \"column\",\n        gap: 12,\n    },\n    title: {\n        fontSize: 32,\n        fontWeight: \"bold\",\n        color: 'white'\n    },\n    description: {\n        fontSize: 18,\n        color: 'white',\n        fontStyle: 'italic',\n        height: 80\n    },\n    gradient: {\n        height: '40%',\n        width: '100%',\n        marginTop: 'auto'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nSo let's see the implementation of `useParallaxWithOpacityAnimations`. In this hook we generate two animated styles \nusing the `useAnimatedStyle` reanimated hook.\nBoth these styles are based on the same `inputRange` that spans between an offset, with respect to the entire \n`FlatList` width, that include the current carousel item, the previous one and the next one.\nWe use this input range to `interpolate` the `scrollX` current value for two different purposes:\n\n* calculate the `translationX` we want to apply on the items to simulate the parallax effects. This style is the one applied to the items images. In this way the \n  animation is tied to the scroll, and given how we defined the intervals and the `inputRange` (far left, center, \n  far right), when the scroll ends, and we are focusing on an item the parallax effect will be 0, and so the item will \n  be perfectly centered (no parallax).\n  It is possible to tweak the `200` (pixel) value used in the output range of `translateX` to increased/decrease the \n  animation (higher, more movement)\n* calculate the `opacity` we want to apply to the items text descriptions. The same consideration we made for the \n  `translationX` applies also here (so in this case item centered/scroll ends, `opacity` is equal to 1, so \n  visible/no opacity)\n\n```tsx\nimport {interpolate, SharedValue, useAnimatedStyle} from \"react-native-reanimated\";\n\nexport const useParallaxWithOpacityAnimations = (\n    index: number,\n    scrollX: SharedValue<number>,\n    width: number\n) => {\n    const inputRange = [\n        (index - 1) * width,\n        index * width,\n        (index + 1) * width,\n    ];\n\n    const parallaxAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n        transform: [{translateX: interpolate(scrollX.value, inputRange, [-200, 0, 200])}],\n    }));\n\n    const opacityAnimatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({\n        opacity: interpolate(scrollX.value, inputRange, [0, 1, 0])\n    }));\n\n    return {\n        parallaxAnimatedStyle,\n        opacityAnimatedStyle,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOne last note: pay attention to the styles `imageContainer` and `itemContainer`, applied to the `Animated.View` that \ncontains the image and to the `View` that contains the carousel item.\nBoth these rules have `overflow: hidden`.\nThis is needed because we are moving around the images, and we don't want them to overlap between each other.\nWe just want the item carousel content to move inside its container, that is basically what a parallax effect is.  \n\nWe are now ready to add our `ParallaxCarousel` component to the `RootLayout` of the expo example app, with some test \ndata.\n\n```tsx\nimport {ParallaxCarousel} from \"@/parallax-carousel/parallax-carousel\";\nconst items = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    image: 'https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/012/201/404/non_2x/beautiful-landscape-of-green-tea-plantation-in-the-morning-with-foreground-orange-flowers-2000-tea-plantation-doi-angkhang-mountain-chiangmai-thailand-free-photo.jpg',\n    title: 'Morning Serenity',\n    description: 'Golden sunlight dances over a lush tea plantation, framed by vibrant orange flowers in the foreground.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    image: 'https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/backcountryhunters/pages/10800/attachments/original/1640022886/Arizona_Lake_Mead_National_Recreation_Area_00003.jpg',\n    title: 'Desert Oasis',\n    description: 'A serene desert lake reflecting the warm hues of the surrounding canyon, an invitation to escape.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: '3',\n    image: 'https://kenkoimagingusa.com/cdn/shop/articles/Simple_Landscape_Photography_Tips_With_Tons_of_Impact.jpg?v=1566068838&width=1920',\n    title: 'Mountain Majesty',\n    description: 'Towering peaks covered in a light mist, standing strong against the backdrop of an endless sky.'\n  },\n];\n\nexport default function RootLayout() {\n  return <ParallaxCarousel items={items} />;\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find the full implementation of what I described above in this [github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Parallax-Carousel).\nIt was quite funny to implement this carousel and the parallax animation.\nI hope I can add more animations during my FriYaY to improve our apps UX :heart:.\n","slug":"/2024/12/31/carousel-parallax-circular-loop-react-native-expo/","description":"Let's see how it is possible to create a circular carousel with parallax effect in React Native.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"8d7f3372-4d41-544b-9e58-edeca82cca65":{"title":"Code review: what it is and why it matters","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about code review: what it is and why it matters.*\n\n---\n\nIn some of my previous posts (for example [in this one](/2017/09/11/clean-code-meaningful-names/ \"clean code meaningful names\")), I talked about my\nnew experience at [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") and how much we care\nabout code quality. In fact I already talked about the fact that we\ndo [pair programming during our daily job](/2018/01/16/ide-refactoring-android-studio-xcode-appcode-webstorm-jetbrains/ \"pair programming\")\n. But pair programming is not the only techniques we use to be sure that our software matches high code quality\nstandard :sunglasses:. One of the most important procedure I use during my daily job with my colleagues is code review.\nWhat is it? Let's see a standard definition from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review \"code review\"):\n\n> A code review is a process where two or more developers visually inspect a set of program code, typically, several times. The code can be a method, a class, or an entire program. The main code-review objectives are:\n>\n>* Best Practice: a more efficient, less error-prone, or more elegant way to accomplish a given task.\n>* Error Detection: discovering logical or transitional errors.\n>* Vulnerability Exposure: identifying and averting common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting, Injection, Buffer Overflow, Excessive Disclosure, etc.\n>* Malware Discovery ~ This often-overlooked and very special code-review objective looks for segments of code that appear extraneous, questionable, or flat-out weird. The intent is to discover back doors, Trojans, and time bombs.\n>\n>In today’s world malevolent code is a very real threat and should not be overlooked, especially by Government agencies.\n\nThe definition is simple and clear. Basically you go through the code of another guy (or from a couple if they are doing\npair programming) to find errors, bugs, code style/best practice not compliant to the team set of rules.  \nThree weeks ago I attended a coding dojo with my\ncolleagues [Angelo Sciarra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelosciarra/ \"Angelo Sciarra\"). Angelo is a senior full-stack\nsoftware engineer with many years of experience. You may wonder now what is also a coding dojo. So again, here we are\nwith another [definition](http://codingdojo.org/WhatIsCodingDojo/ \"coding dojo\") :bowtie::\n\n> A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They have fun and they engage in order to improve their skills.\n\nDuring the dojo that I attended with Angelo we tried to resolve\nthe [Minesweeper problem](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Minesweeper/ \"Minesweeper\"). Basically we had to write an automatic\nMinesweeper resolver (do you remember the Windows game? :heart_eyes:). At the end of the dojo we didn't complete the\ntask, so I decided to try to solve it in another way. I developed a complete command line version of a Minesweeper\nresolver and let Angelo do the code review of my implementation. In this way I can show you the power of code review :\nneckbeard: (and last but not least how much meticulous is Angelo during his code review :cold_sweat::sweat_smile::\ncupid:).  \nYou can find the final version of the minesweeper after the code review\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Katas/tree/master/minesweeper/java-minesweeper).  \nTo facilitate you in the navigation of the two different implementations I created\ntwo [class diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram \"class diagram\"): one that describe my implementation\nbefore the code review, and the second one that shows the final result after Angelo's code review. The following one\ndescribes my implementation of the minesweeper.\n\n![Class diagram of my personal implementation of minesweeper](../images/posts/minesweeper-fabrizio.jpg)\n\nThis one describes Angelo's implementation.\n\n![Class diagram of Angelo Sciarra implementation of minesweeper](../images/posts/minesweeper-angelo.jpg)\n\nSo let's start to see which kind of observation I received from Angelo, that basically include most of the observation\nyou could receive during a code review. The first observation I received from Angelo is about the java JDK version I\nused for my project. I did the setup of the project using JDK 1.5 instead of JDK 1.8 (as you may know, this is a more\nrecent version). In general it is common to receive suggestion about technology specific problems/setup/changes,\nespecially if your code reviewer is more experienced than you on that type of technology.\n\n![Technology update from Java 1.5 to Java 1.8](../images/posts/01-technology-version-update.jpg)\n\nIn fact Angelo gave me another technology advice during his review. He suggested to change some pieces of code with\nothers that leverage the power of functional programming. This is really interesting because it is easy imagine how much\nknowledge you can absorb from the experience of your code reviewer.\n\n![Functional improvements to the original class](../images/posts/03-functional-field.jpg)\n\n![A new field class has been introduced to describe a list of fields](../images/posts/04-new-fields-class.jpg)\n\nAnother important aspect that is one of the main subject of the code review is software design. In fact Angelo\ndiscovered a series of improvement and refactoring opportunities in my code:\n\n* the `Minesweeper` class doesn't need to receive the fields input at construction time but directly in the `play()`\n  method. In this way the `Minesweeper` class becomes a stateless object, and the same instance could be used to\n  resolve/unmask multiple fields input.\n\n![Minesweeper class is now a stateless object](../images/posts/02-minesweeper-fields-as-parameter.jpg)\n\n* The objects that are the building block of\n  a [chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern \"chain of responsability\")\n  named `FieldRowParser` could become lighter and some of their responsibility could be assigned to some new\n  collaborators. Also the object that contains the parsing status could become more lighter.\n\n![A lightweight chain has been introduced for the row parsing](../images/posts/05-lightweight-chain.jpg)\n\n![A new ParsingContext class keeps the current status of the parsing](../images/posts/07-parsing-status-become-parsing-content-lightweight.jpg)\n\nAs you can see from these kind of comments the code review could really improve the general architectural design of your\napplication :heart_eyes::relieved:. Code convention are another important thing to check during code review. For example\nAngelo told me to move all the constants at the beginning of some of the classes. Usually tools like Github or Gitlab\nlet you discuss your code review by adding comments directly to the code.\n\n![Constants should be at the top of the class](../images/posts/08-constants-beginning-of-file.jpg)\n\n![A comment related to a team guideline](../images/posts/06-guidelines.jpg)\n\nLast but not least, if you are a real fan of clean code, you know\nthat [meaningful names are important](/2017/09/11/clean-code-meaningful-names/ \"clean code meaningful names\"). So\nyou can suggest some more meaningful name for a class, variable or method.\n\n![An example of using meaningful names](../images/posts/10-rename-masker.jpg)\n\nThat's all for code review. I hope you understood how much important it is to do it and how much your codebase can\nimprove if you use code review as a validation tool and as a tool to find new refactoring opportunities (anyway, I hope\nAngelo will never be your reviewer :laughing::sparkling_heart:).\n","slug":"/2018/03/02/code-review-whats-it-is-and-why-it-is-important/","description":"In this post I will talk about code review: what it is and why it matters.","authors":["angelo-sciarra","fabrizio-duroni"]},"8df5a269-a8cc-55d4-865f-77927ba0ed1c":{"title":"A Domain Driven Design dictionary for newbies","content":"\n*In the last months, I started to hear a lot of stuff about Domain Driven Design. What is DDD? What does it try to\nsolve? This is a post for all the newbies (like me) that are searching for a definition of what DDD is, which are its\nmain parts and what is its main goal.*\n\n---\n\nIn the last months the main focus of my daily job at [lastminute.com group](https://www.lastminute.com) was the existing refund process \ndevelopment in order to support our customer hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. While I’m still working (a lot :laughing:)\non it, I also had the opportunity to participate in the start up of a new project (anyway, still related to the \nrefund stuff :sweat_smile:). In this new project we decided to take leverage of the power of DDD to approach the \nproblem we need to solve. In my mind I said: ”Ok, let’s do it”, but then I started to think: ”What the f%*§ is this DDD? I do know nothing\nabout it” :sweat_smile:.  \nThis is why I recently attended the video course “Domain Driven Design Distilled”\nby [Vaughn Vernon](https://twitter.com/vaughnvernon?lang=en), one of the top expert about DDD. In this post I will try\nto share with you what I learnt about DDD and I will try to give you the best (opinionated) definition of DDD and of all\nits parts.\n\n#### DDD\n\nSo let’s start from the basis. What is DDD? DDD is a set of tools that help an organization to model software around its\nbusiness model. Generally speaking a company CAN’T be the best at everything. The DDD tools help organizations to better\nunderstand their business and to choose at what they should excel. In this way through DDD an organization can implement\nwhat is usually called Effective Design to develop its software. Its main features are:\n\n* The final design meets the needs of the business to distinguish itself from the  other competitors.\n* Force the organization where it should excel.\n\nFor the second point, I would like to quote a phrase from the Vernon DDD distilled course:\n\n> ..An organization that works in the insurance industry, should try to be the best insurance company in that particular insurance area it operates. But it can’t be the best database company as well, or it can’t be the framework company, it can’t be the best accounting comparing as well an so on…\n\nI think the statement above describes the needs of about 99% percent of the business I worked for in the last 13 years :flushed:.  \nThe DDD tools that will let you implement effective design are divided in two main phases:\n\n* Strategic design\n* Tactical design\n\nLet’s see each one of them in details.\n\n#### Strategic design\n\nStrategic design is the first phase of DDD. With a set of specific tool strategic design will let you highlight what is\nbetter important for your business. In this phase your domain models will be divided into smaller units, and they \nwill be prioritized in terms of analysis/development efforts based on their importance. Strategic design is based primarily on\ntwo tools:\n\n* Bounded context\n* Ubiquitous language\n\nLet’s see them in details.\n\n#### Bounded Context and Ubiquitous language\n\nLet’s start from the definition of Bounded Context from the Vaughn Vernon course:\n\n> …a Bounded Context is a semantic contextual boundary. This means that within the boundary each component of the software model has a specific meaning and does specific things. The components inside a Bounded Context are context specific and semantically motivated…\n\nFrom the definition (and also from the name itself :laughing: ) a bounded context is a specific limit boundary within a\nsoftware model. Inside a bounded context everything is explicit about the model. The software model inside a bounded\ncontext is created using terms from a language developed by the team working on the it. This language is called\nUbiquitous language and its main features are:\n\n* It should be rigorous and non ambiguous\n* It should be understood by all the team members\n\nUsually the team that is working on a bounded context should work strictly with a business domain expert to better\ndefine the ubiquitous language and to avoid mixing up concepts from different Bounded Context. Below you can find Vernon\ndefinition of what an Ubiquitous languages is.\n\n> …The software model inside the context boundary reflects a language that is developed by the team working in the Bounded Context and is spoken by every member of the team that creates the software model that functions within that Bounded Context. The language is called the Ubiquitous Language because it is both spoken among the team members and implemented in the software model…\n\n![DDD bounded context ubiquitous language (credits “DDD distilled” by V. Vernon)](../images/posts/ddd-bounded-context-ubiquitous-language.jpg)\n\nHow many bounded context will your project have? How do they map to your business domain parts. Let’s answer to these\nquestion with Subdomain\n\n#### Subdomains\n\nLet’s start as always from the Vernon definition of what a subdomain is.\n\n> …a Subdomain is a sub-part of your overall business domain. You can think of a Subdomain as representing a single, \n> logical domain model. Most business domains are usually too large and complex to reason about as a whole, so we \n> generally concern ourselves only with the Subdomains that we must use within a single project. Subdomains can be \n> used to logically break up your whole business domain so that you can understand your problem space on a large, \n> complex project.  \n>\n> Another way to think of a Subdomain is that it is a clear area of expertise, assuming that it is responsible for \n> providing a solution to a core area of your business. This implies that the particular Subdomain will have one or \n> more Domain Experts who understand very well the aspects of the business that a specific Subdomain facilitates. \n> The Subdomain also has greater or lesser strategic significance to your business...\n\nIn DDD, a subdomain maps to a single bounded context. The domain expert of a particular subdomain are an active part of\nthe team in charge of the related bounded context. There are 3 types of subdomains:\n\n* Core domain: the most important subdomain of your organization. This is what differentiate your company from the\n  competition in terms of business features. This is the domain where an organization will invest most of its energy and\n  resources.\n* Supporting subdomain: this is a subdomain where the organization should invest in terms of development effort because\n  there isn’t an existing software solution that covers the business needs. Anyway this subdomain is not as important as\n  the Core Domain from a strategical point of view. This is the reason why this kind of development are usually \n  outsourced to external companies in order to avoid putting too much effort and resources on it.\n* Generic subdomain: this kind of subdomains includes needs where a software solution is already available to be\n  purchased without the needs for any development efforts.\n\n![Type of DDD subdomains (credits “DDD distilled” by V. Vernon)](../images/posts/ddd-subdomains.jpg)\n\nFrom the definition above it should be clear that every software project will have multiple subdomains and bounded\ncontext. How do you integrate them together?\n\n#### Context mapping\n\nContext mapping lets you integrate different bounded contexts. It is the translation between them. It is important to\nevaluate the “translation” trade off when a context mapping is required. This is usually related to the type of relation\nbetween bounded context we would like to achieve. In particular its important to consider the real needs of a\nrelationship two bounded contexts. There are various types of context mapping:\n\n* Partnership: two teams of two different bounded context have a partnership relation. The teams are synchronized on\n  goals and schedules. Usually a Partnership context mapping is defined for a limited time period.\n* Shared Kernel: the teams share a common model. It is not easy to be successful in this kind of context mapping. it\n  requires an high commitment in terms of shared agreement between the teams.\n* Customer-Supplier: as the name implies, the teams work in a “customer supplier” way. It’s important that the supplier\n  understand the real needs of its customer in order to avoid an evolution of the model not needed by the customer.\n* Conformist: - Conformist: a team will integrate with a very large and complex model that is already well established by another\n  team.\n* Anticorruption layer: a translation layer is created between the communication of teams from different bounded\n  context. In this way the teams that receive the information could adapt them based on the their specific business\n  needs. It should be used whenever possible.\n* Open Host Service: similar to Anticorruption layer but without the translation layer. In this case a team A uses the\n  APIs from a team B, and the business model inside it, without any translation.\n* Published language: a well defined language is defined in order to enable the consumption of a model from a bounded\n  context from the other bounded contexts. Usually you can use some well know format like XML, JSON, Avro, Protobuf etc.\n  to defined the published language.\n* Separate ways: last but not least, you can use decide to not integrate with another bounded context and create your\n  own specialized solution (eg. a new solution in your own bounded context is much more simple to create than the\n  integration with another bounded context).\n\n#### Tactical design\n\nIn the previous paragraph we explored all the details of Strategic Design. At this point I think it’s clear that\nStrategic Design is an high level design phase, because it lets you define the subdivision of your domain and of your\nsoftware model without entering into details. In particular, at this point with strategic design we defined all our\nbounded contexts but not what live inside them. All the details of the bounded contexts are defined in the Tactical\nDesign phase.  \nWhat are the details we want to define during the Tactical Design? We would like to define the concepts contained in a\nbounded context. This are usually represented as Aggregates.\n\n#### Aggregates\n\nAn aggregate is a set of domain objects, usually called Entities and Value Objects, that are considered as a single item\ninside our bounded context. One of the entities that make up the Aggregate is called the Aggregate Root or Root Entity.\nThis entity owns all the others inside the aggregate. Value objects are used, as the name implies, to represent values.\nWe can have a look at Vernon definition that I think is enough clear.\n\n> A Value Object, or simply a Value, models an immutable conceptual whole. Within the model the Value is just that, a value. Unlike an Entity, it does not have a unique identity, and equivalence is determined by comparing the attributes encapsulated by the Value type. Furthermore, a Value Object is not a thing but is often used to describe, quantify, or measure an Entity.\n\nThe most important feature of aggregates is that they represents transactional boundaries. Again let’s quote Vernon to\nunderstand the meaning of this concept.\n\n> …Aggregate forms a transactional consistency boundary. This means that within a single Aggregate, all composed parts must be consistent, according to business rules, when the controlling transaction is committed…\n\nSimple and clear. All the parts of an aggregate must be consistent when saved. So they should be saved in a single\n“transaction”. In this case the concept of transaction is much more broader than the one usually related to database. In\nfact the type of transaction used to save your aggregate is an implementation details. It could be a database\ntransatction, or could be something implemented using Reactive programming events/messaging.  \nThere are 4 rules of thumb reported by Vernon to be considered when you’re creating aggregates:\n\n![DDD aggregates rule of thumb (credits “DDD distilled” by V. Vernon)](../images/posts/ddd-aggregates-rules-of-thumb.jpg)\n\nLet’s try to analyze them. The first one refer to the fact that the business should determine Aggregate anatomy based\non what should be consistent when a transaction is committed.  \nThe second one is easy (and common in computer science :laughing:): keep your aggregates small in order to reduce memory\nfootprint and complexity. The third one also is simple and clear: aggregates should reference each other by identity\nfields in order to (again) reduce memory footprint but also, and more important in this case, enforce the transactional\nboundary that each aggregate represents.  \nLast but not least the eventual consistency update rule. As we already said, aggregates are transactional boundaries.\nHow do we signal that another aggregate should be updated when another one finished its update transaction? We can use a\nmessaging mechanism in order to guarantee that after the transaction on one aggregates, others should be updated too.\nFor this scope Domain Events come to rescue us.\n\n#### Domain Events\n\nLet’ quote (again :laughing:) the Vernon definition of Domain Events.\n\n> A Domain Event is a record of some business-significant occurrence in a Bounded Context.\n\n![DDD domain events (credits “DDD distilled” by V. Vernon)](../images/posts/ddd-domain-events.jpg)\n\nSo domain events are the fundamentals of communication between aggregates in order to keep them eventual consistent\nbetween each other. When creating domain events we should put a lot of attention to decide its name: should be a\nstatement of a past occurrence, that is, a verb in the past tense, that describe what happened in the aggregate that\noriginated the event. The combination of the Domain Event’s name and its properties are the record of what happened in\nthe domain model. Domain events are usually stored with its aggregate. It’s important to save them together in the same\ntransaction. Should domain events contain additional data? Yes, but as Vernon says we must be careful to not fil them\nwith too much data\n\n> …there are times when a Domain Event can be enriched with additional data. This can be especially helpful to consumers that don’t want to query back on your Bounded Context to obtain additional data that they need. Even so, you must be careful not to fill up a Domain Event with so much data that it loses its meaning…\n\nAs we said above domain events should be saved while updating aggregates. This is useful in order to have a clear\nunderstand of what happened to an aggregates. We can also use them to implement event sourcing.\n\n#### Event sourcing\n\nEvent sourcing is a technique where an aggregate current state is reconstructed by applying in temporal order all the\ndomain events related to an aggregate. Let’s take a look at the explanation from Vernon:\n\n> Event Sourcing can be described as persisting all Domain Events that have occurred for an Aggregate instance as a record of what changed about that Aggregate instance. Rather than persisting the Aggregate state as a whole, you store all the individual Domain Events that have happened to it. Let’s step through how this is supported.    \n> All of the Domain Events that have occurred for one Aggregate instance, ordered as they originally occurred, make up its event stream. The event stream begins with the first Domain Event that ever occurred for the Aggregate instance and continues until the last Domain Event that occurred. As new Domain Events occur for a given Aggregate instance, they are appended to the end of its event stream. Reapplying the event stream to the Aggregate allows its state to be reconstituted from persistence back into memory. In other words, when using Event Sourcing, an Aggregate that was removed from memory for any reason is reconstituted entirely from its event stream.\n\nEvent sourcing has a lot of advantages, from a business point of view and from the developer point of view. One of the\ngreatest advantages of using it from the business point of view is that you have historical data that you can use for\nmany reasons, ones that you can imagine today, such as compliance and analytics, and ones that you won’t realize until\nlater. For developers it can enable them to use event streams to examine usage trends and to debug their source code.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIf you came until here I hope you enjoyed the read, but more important that you found the answers you were searching\nfor.

I started to use it for a personal project to understand its\npotential. Let's see how I used SwiftUI to create a custom TabBar with modal and detail navigation.*\n\n---\n\n**NB.: Considering the success of this blog post, I decided to create a new custom TabBar SwiftUI library called [TabBarUIAction](https://github.com/chicio/TabBarUIAction \"TabBArUIAction custom tab bar swiftui\"). Go and check it out!!!**\n\nIn the last week I started to develop a new personal project: a new iOS mobile app (that I will show you in the following months). \nAs a consequence of the fact that this was a greenfield project I decided to use SwiftUI to develop all the User \nInterface and Combine for data binging. These frameworks are the Apple implementation of reactive programming \n(combine) and declarative user interface programming (SwiftUI). In this post we will focus on SwiftUI (we will see \ncombine in another post later :wink:). Even if it is still not ready for a complete production product because\n[a lot of UIKit part are missing and you have to expose them manually](https://goshdarnswiftui.com/#framework-integration-uikit-in-swiftui) \nand because some stuff doesn't work as expected, SwiftUI is a big step forward with respect to the old imperative \nUIKit approach (sometimes I still have headache about Autolayout issues and constraint definition :astonished::smile:).  \nIn this post I will show you how I created a custom tab bar with the ability to open a modal from a tab bar item \n(like some major apps, e.g. Instagram) and a customized navigation where the TabBar is shown only on the first level \nof navigation. Below you can find a video that shows the final result.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOG9y24zCIg`\n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start by defining and enum that will identify our tabs in a more expressive way. In the custom tab bar there will\nbe three element, but only two are real tabs (as you see from the video above the one in the middle is modal).\n\n```swift\nenum Tab {\n    case Tab1\n    case Tab2\n}\n```\n\nThe main view `MainView` contains 2 variable fields:\n\n* `currentView`, a `@State` variable that keeps the current tab selected\n* `showModal`, a `@State` variable that is used to manage the presentation of the modal from the central button of the\n  TabBar\n\nThe `body` of the view is composed by a `NavigationView` that contains a `VStack` with main components of the custom tab\nbar implementation:\n\n* `CurrentScreen`, that contains and show the current screen selected\n* `TabBar`, that contains custom tab bar with all its logic\n\nThere are also some style customization like forcing the `navigationViewStyle` to `StackNavigationViewStyle`, in order\nto avoid to see a blank screen on iPad (because the `NavigationView` on iPad is a split view by default :laughing:).\nLast but not least, there is a `sheet` defined to show a `ScreenModal` view as a modal whenever the state\nvariable `showModal` changes and the property `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)` on the `VStack` to avoid movement of the\ntabbar when the current screen needs to show the keyboard.\n\n```swift\nstruct MainView: View {\n    @State private var currentView: Tab = .Tab1\n    @State private var showModal: Bool = false\n\n    var body: some View {\n        NavigationView {\n            VStack {\n                CurrentScreen(currentView: self.$currentView)\n                TabBar(currentView: self.$currentView, showModal: self.$showModal)\n            }\n            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)\n        }\n        .background(Color(.white))\n        .navigationViewStyle(StackNavigationViewStyle())\n        .sheet(isPresented: self.$showModal) { ScreenModal() }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's see first the implementation of the `CurrentView`. This view is really simple: it shows a specific screen based on\nthe value of its `currentView`. As you may already noticed, `currentView` is a not a state variable. It is annotated\nwith the property wrapper `@Binding`. What does it mean? The `@Binding` property wrapper lets us declare that one value\nactually comes from elsewhere, and should be shared in both places. This basically means that this variable will be\nupdated as soon as the variable passed at construction time for this view will be update, and the view will be update\nconsequently by changing the screen shown.\n\n```swift\nstruct CurrentScreen: View {\n    @Binding var currentView: Tab\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            if self.currentView == .Tab1 {\n                Screen1()\n            } else {\n                Screen2()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's see the `TabBar` implementation. Also this view contains two `@Binding` variables:\n\n* The first one is again `currentView`, that will be updated by its children `TabBaItem`  views whenever the user will\n  tap on them.\n* The other one is `showModal`, that is a boolean modified by the `ShowModalTabBarItem` with the method `toggle()`, that\n  invert the current value of the boolean. As you remember we defined a state variable `showModal` in the `MainView`. So\n  as soon as the user taps on `ShowModalTabBarItem` the `showModal` state is modified and the `MainView` will show a\n  modal screen `ScreenModal`.  \n  Beautiful!! :heart_eyes:\n\n```swift\nstruct TabBar: View {\n    @Binding var currentView: Tab\n    @Binding var showModal: Bool\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            TabBarItem(currentView: self.$currentView, imageName: \"list.bullet\", paddingEdges: .leading, tab: .Tab1)\n            Spacer()\n            ShowModalTabBarItem(radius: 55) { self.showModal.toggle() }\n            Spacer()\n            TabBarItem(currentView: self.$currentView, imageName: \"gear\", paddingEdges: .trailing, tab: .Tab2)\n        }\n        .frame(minHeight: 70)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe implementation of `TabBarItem` is simple. It contains the styling for the tab bar item. The important thing to\nnotice is here is the `onTapGesture` modifier. Whenever a user taps on it the `@Binding currentView`  variable will be\nupdated and so also the `@State` variable `currentView` in the `MainView` and consequently also the `CurrentScreen` view\nwill be update.\n\n```swift\nstruct TabBarItem: View {\n    @Binding var currentView: Tab\n    let imageName: String\n    let paddingEdges: Edge.Set\n    let tab: Tab\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing:0) {\n            Image(systemName: imageName)\n                .resizable()\n                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)\n                .padding(5)\n                .frame(width: 40, height: 40, alignment: .center)\n                .background(Color(self.currentView == tab ? .blue : .white).opacity(0.2))\n                .foregroundColor(Color(self.currentView == tab ? .blue : .black))\n                .cornerRadius(6)\n        }\n        .frame(width: 100, height: 50)\n        .onTapGesture { self.currentView = self.tab }\n        .padding(paddingEdges, 15)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `ShowModalTabBarItem` is also simple. It contains the style for the custom TabBar item and it attach the action to\nshow the modal to the view with the `onTapGestureModifier`.\n\n```swift\npublic struct ShowModalTabBarItem: View {\n    let radius: CGFloat\n    let action: () -> Void\n\n    public init(radius: CGFloat, action: @escaping () -> Void) {\n        self.radius = radius\n        self.action = action\n    }\n\n    public var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing:0) {\n            Image(systemName: \"plus.circle.fill\")\n                .resizable()\n                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)\n                .frame(width: radius, height: radius, alignment: .center)\n                .foregroundColor(Color(.systemBlue))\n                .background(Color(.white))\n                .cornerRadius(radius/2)\n                .overlay(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: radius/2).stroke(Color(.blue), lineWidth: 2))\n\n        }\n        .frame(width: radius, height: radius)\n        .onTapGesture(perform: action)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`Screen1`, `Screen2` and `ScreenModal` are full screen `VStack` view that defined the content for each screen. The\nimportant part is the definition of the title on `Screen1` and `Screen2` to modify the navigation bar using\nthe `navigationBarTitle` modifier. In the `Screen1` view there's also a `NavigationLink` that let us navigate to a\ndetail/second level screen. As you remember in the `MainView` we defined a `NavigationView` as container of the custom\nTabBar with the current content. This let us keep the TabBar only on the first level of navigation and it when the user\nenters in the details screen.\n\n```swift\nstruct Screen1: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Spacer()\n            HStack {\n                Spacer()\n                Text(\"Screen 1\")\n                    .font(.system(size: 20))\n                    .bold()\n                Spacer()\n            }\n            HStack {\n                NavigationLink(destination: ScreenDetail()) { Text(\"Show detail\") }\n            }\n            Spacer()\n        }\n        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)\n        .background(Color(.yellow).opacity(0.2))\n        .navigationBarTitle(\"Screen 1\")\n    }\n}\n\n//...\n\nstruct Screen2: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Spacer()\n            HStack {\n                Spacer()\n                Text(\"Screen 2\")\n                    .font(.system(size: 20))\n                    .bold()\n                Spacer()\n            }\n            Spacer()\n        }\n        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)\n        .background(Color(.purple).opacity(0.2))\n        .navigationBarTitle(\"Screen 2\")\n    }\n}\n\n//...\n\nstruct ScreenModal: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Spacer()\n            HStack {\n                Spacer()\n                Text(\"Screen 2\")\n                Spacer()\n            }\n            Spacer()\n        }\n        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)\n        .background(Color(.red).opacity(0.2))\n        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find all the code shown in this\npost [in this Github repo](https://github.com/chicio/SwiftUI-CustomTabBar \"custom tab bar swiftui\"). Apple has done a\ngreat job with SwiftUI and I hope that the framework will receive in the future updates all the missing UIKit pieces (\nwhile still missing a [lot of stuff on the web/Safari side](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/)).

In these last few months, a lot has happened in my personal \nand professional life. This shifted away my attention from my personal blog. Now I finally have some free time, and \nhere I am sick (flu is hitting hard in this period) with a new series of stories about something I accomplished \nduring this December 2023.  \nI decided to participate in the first edition of the \"Advent of TypeScript\" created by TypeHero. For those who don't \nknow them, [TypeHero](https://github.com/typehero/typehero) is a community of TypeScript developers with the aim to share and improve the knowledge about \nthe powerful TypeScript type system (and the language itself).  \n  \nI suppose most of you reading this article knows what an advent calendar is :innocent:. For the others, an advent \ncalendar is a piece of card incorporating numbered flaps, one for each day from December 1 until December 25. \nEach of these flaps is opened on each day of advent to reveal (usually) a candy of a chocolate as a reward.  \n[\"Advent of TypeScript\"](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023) follows the same rules: 25 flaps, each one to be opened on \nan advent day, but instead of chocolate every day you find a new TypeScript challenge :smirk:. And that's not all: \nthe interesting fact about these challenges was that they had to be solved using only TypeScript type system :cold_sweat:.  \nI said \"ok, let's see how far I can go with this\", and here I am one month later with all the challenges completed \nthe day they were published :relaxed:.  \n  \nI will be honest: it has been hard has hell. The knowledge I have of TypeScript type system \"saved me\" from being \nscrewed for the first 5 days :sweat_smile:. After these initial days,\nthe challenges started to explore advanced type system concept that I didn't know about. This means that to solve \nevery challenge after the first ones, I had to study A LOT (really, a lot). I didn't count the hours I spent in \ntotal for solving all of them, but I'm quite sure that if I sum up all the hours I spent on it will surpass an \nentire week :cold_sweat: (just to remember, time I spent studying/programming after my daily job). It was quite \nsome time since I spent so many extra work hours on a side project (for the reasons I mentioned at the beginning).  \nLet's see some statistics in terms of participation to this \"Advent of TypeScript\", that you can find also [here](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023/wrapped \"advent of typescript stats\").  \nAs always, the initial participation was very high more than 11000 people solved the first exercise. But as you can \nsee from the photo below, there is already a big drop since the second day :sweat_smile:.  \n\n![Advent of TypeScript: first days result](../images/posts/advent-of-typescript-first.jpg \"Advent of TypeScript: first days result\")\n\nThen we arrived to the latest days challenges, and I was surprised to know that **I was one among only 200 \ndevelopers in the world to complete all the 25 challenges :loudspeaker:**.\n\n![Advent of TypeScript: last days result](../images/posts/advent-of-typescript-last.jpg \"Advent of TypeScript: last days \nresult\")\n\nAll this to say: I would like to share with you the solutions for the 4 challenges that I liked the most. In this \n way, I hope I will share with you some knowledge I acquired while solving them, and you will have the same \"eureka \nmoments\" I had about TypeScript type system.  \nBefore you jump into the articles, I suggest that you have a look at these topics from the TypeScript official docs. \nIn this way, reading the articles will be easier:\n\n* [keyof operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html)\n* [Conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html)\n* [Mapped types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html)\n* [Template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html)\n\nSo which are the 4 challenges I like the most? Here they are:\n\n* [Rock, Paper, Scissors](/2023/12/30/advent-of-typescript-2023-rock-paper-scissors/ \"rock paper scissors\")\n* [Tic Tac Toe](/2024/01/04/advent-of-typescript-2023-tic-tac-toe/ \"tic tac toe\")\n* [Connect 4](/2024/01/20/advent-of-typescript-2023-connect-4/ \"Connect 4\")\n* [Santa is stuck!](/2024/01/31/advent-of-typescript-2023-santa-is-stuck/ \"Santa is stuck\")\n\n\n\n\n","slug":"/2023/12/29/advent-of-typescript-2023-favourite-challenges/","description":"This year I participated in the first edition of Advent of TypeScript created by TypeHero.

In\nthis post I will describe how I created ID3TagEditor.*\n\n---\n\nIn [this previous post](/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/ \"born id3tageditor mp3id3tagger\") I described\nthe reason why I\ndeveloped [ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor \"id3 tag editor swift ios macOS tvOS watchOS linux\"), a\nswift library to edit ID3 tag of mp3 files with support for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. In this post I will described\nhow I developed it. Below you can find the library logo.\n\n![The ID3TagEditor logo](../images/posts/id3tageditor-logo.jpg)\n\nBut before going deeper in the details of ID3TagEditor it useful to know how the ID3 tag standard works (you can find\nthe full reference on the [official site](http://id3.org/ \"id3 standard\")). The definition reported on it for the ID3\nstandard is:\n\n> An ID3 tag is a data container within an MP3 audio file stored in a prescribed format\n\nThis definition means that an ID3 tag is basically a chunk of information stored at the beginning of an mp3 file. The\nstandard defines the format that any developer can use to read and write this information. Let's see an example of an\nID3 tag using a hex editor.\n\n![An ID3 tag example shown with an hex editor](../images/posts/id3-tag-example.jpg)\n\nA tag is composed of a header and a series of frames. The tag header has a size of 10 bytes contains the following\ninformation (for both v2 and v3):\n\n* ID3 tag file identifier, 3 bytes, usually represented as \"ID3\"\n* tag version, 2 bytes, a couple of number that represent the major version and the revision version (e.g. `0x03 0x00`)\n* flags, 1 bytes, contains three configurations flags represented as `%abc00000` (bit to 1)\n* size, 4 bytes. Quoting the ID3 standard the size is:\n\n> the size of the complete tag after unsychronisation, including padding, excluding the header but not excluding the extended header. The ID3v2 tag size is encoded with four bytes where the most significant bit (bit 7) is set to zero in every byte, making a total of 28 bits. The zeroed bits are ignored, so a 257 bytes long tag is represented as $00 00 02 01. .... Only 28 bits(representing up to 256MB) are used in the size description...\n\n![An ID3 tag header example](../images/posts/id3-tag-header.jpg)\n\nA frame is composed of an header and a custom content. The frame header contains the following information, that change\nin size between versions:\n\n* frame id, 3 bytes in version 2 and 4 bytes in version 3\n* size, 3 bytes in version 2 and 4 bytes in version 3 that the describe the total size of the frame excluding the header\n* option flags, 2 bytes available only in version 3\n\nSo the frame header size is 10 bytes in version 3 and 6 bytes in version 2. After the header there is the custom\nspecific frame flags/options and the frame content. Below you can find an example of a frame in a version 3 tag.\n\n![An ID3 frame example](../images/posts/id3-frame-example.jpg)\n\nLast but not least at the end of the ID3 tag there are also 2 KB of offset (you can see it in the previous images, that\nseries of endless `0x00` at the end of the tag :relieved:). How does ID3TagEditor read and write all this information?\nThe main api of the framework are two simple methods:\n\n```swift\n/**\n Read the ID3 tag contained in the mp3 file.\n\n - parameter path: path of the mp3 file to be parsed.\n\n - throws: Could throw `InvalidFileFormat` if an mp3 file doesn't exists at the specified path.\n\n - returns: an ID3 tag or nil, if a tag doesn't exists in the file.\n */\npublic func read(from path: String) throws -> ID3Tag?\n\n/**\n Writes the mp3 to a new file or overwrite it with the new ID3 tag.\n\n - parameter tag: the ID3 tag that written in the mp3 file.\n - parameter path: path of the mp3 file where we will write the tag.\n - parameter newPath: path where the file with the new tag will be written. **If nil, the mp3 file will be overwritten**.\n If nothing is passed, the file will be overwritten at its current location.\n\n - throws: Could throw `TagTooBig` (tag size > 256 MB) or `InvalidTagData` (no data set to be written in the\n ID3 tag).\n */\npublic func write(tag: ID3Tag, to path: String, andSaveTo newPath: String? = nil) throws\n\n```\n\nSo the ID3TagEditor framework has two main parts: one for read/parse an mp3 file and one for write an ID3 tag to the mp3\nfile.  \nLet's start from the read/parsing part. The main entry point of the library is the class `ID3TagParser` that is\ninstantiated from a `ID3TagParserFactory`. Its main function is the called `parse`. As the name suggest it parses the\nvarious frames. Before that there are three operation:\n\n* the version of the tag is extracted by a collaborator called `ID3TagVersionParser`\n* a check if a tag is available in the mp3 file loaded. This check is done by a collaborator named `ID3TagPresence`\n* the size of the tag is extracted by a collaborator called `ID3TagSizeParser`\n\n```swift\n....\n\nfunc parse(mp3: Data) -> ID3Tag? {\n    let version = tagVersionParser.parse(mp3: mp3 as Data)\n    if (tagPresence.isTagPresentIn(mp3: mp3 as Data, version: version)) {\n        let id3Tag = ID3Tag(version: version, size: 0)\n        parseTagSizeFor(mp3: mp3 as NSData, andSaveInId3Tag: id3Tag)\n        parseFramesFor(mp3: mp3 as NSData, id3Tag: id3Tag)\n        return id3Tag\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\n....\n```\n\nThe parsing of each frame is done in the function `parseFramesFor`.\n\n```swift\n....\nprivate func parseFramesFor(mp3: NSData, id3Tag: ID3Tag) {\n    var currentFramePosition = id3TagConfiguration.headerSize();\n    while currentFramePosition < id3Tag.properties.size {\n        let frame = getFrameFrom(mp3: mp3, position: currentFramePosition, version: id3Tag.properties.version)\n        frameContentParser.parse(frame: frame, id3Tag: id3Tag)\n        currentFramePosition += frame.count;\n    }\n}\n\nprivate func getFrameFrom(mp3: NSData, position: Int, version: ID3Version) -> Data {\n    let frameSize = frameSizeParser.parse(mp3: mp3, framePosition: position, version: version)\n    let frame = mp3.subdata(with: NSMakeRange(position, frameSize))\n    return frame\n}\n....\n```\n\nHow does the parsing for each frame work? How does ID3TagEditor recognize the correct frame and execute the correct\nparsing based on the frame type? The answer is inside the `ID3FrameContentParser` class, used inside\nthe `parseFramesFor(mp3: NSData, id3Tag: ID3Tag)` function. This class uses the [**Command Pattern**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) to launch the correct parsing operations for the current frame\ntype. The list of frame parsing operations is stored inside inside a dictionary where the key is the `FrameType` enum.\nThis enum generically identify the frame type, and is mapped to the correct ID3 frame identifier for each version in\nthe `ID3FrameConfiguration` function `frameTypeFor(identifier: frameIdentifier, version: version)`. As you can see below\nthe extraction of the frame identifier is done in the `getFrameTypeFrom(frame: Data, version: ID3Version) -> FrameType`.\n\n```swift\nclass ID3FrameContentParser: FrameContentParser {\n    private let frameContentParsingOperations: [FrameType : FrameContentParsingOperation]\n    private var id3FrameConfiguration: ID3FrameConfiguration\n\n    init(frameContentParsingOperations: [FrameType : FrameContentParsingOperation],\n         id3FrameConfiguration: ID3FrameConfiguration) {\n        self.frameContentParsingOperations = frameContentParsingOperations\n        self.id3FrameConfiguration = id3FrameConfiguration\n    }\n\n    func parse(frame: Data, id3Tag: ID3Tag) {\n        let frameType = getFrameTypeFrom(frame: frame, version: id3Tag.properties.version)\n        if (isAValid(frameType: frameType)) {\n            frameContentParsingOperations[frameType]?.parse(frame: frame, id3Tag: id3Tag)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func getFrameTypeFrom(frame: Data, version: ID3Version) -> FrameType {\n        let frameIdentifierSize = id3FrameConfiguration.identifierSizeFor(version: version)\n        let frameIdentifierData = [UInt8](frame.subdata(in: Range(0...frameIdentifierSize - 1)))\n        let frameIdentifier = toString(frameIdentifier: frameIdentifierData)\n        let frameType = id3FrameConfiguration.frameTypeFor(identifier: frameIdentifier, version: version)\n        return frameType\n    }\n\n    private func isAValid(frameType: FrameType) -> Bool {\n        return frameType != .Invalid\n    }\n\n    private func toString(frameIdentifier: [UInt8]) -> String {\n        return frameIdentifier.reduce(\"\") { (convertedString, byte) -> String in\n            return convertedString + String(Character(UnicodeScalar(byte)))\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf we want to go deeper we can have a look at the `ID3FrameContentParsingOperationFactory`. This class initialize the\nclasses used as command to parse the various type of frames. I will talk about their implementation details in other\nposts (because this classes contain a lot of cool swift stuff that I can use to write a lot of other posts :smirk:).\n\n```swift\nclass ID3FrameContentParsingOperationFactory {\n    static func make() -> [FrameType : FrameContentParsingOperation] {\n        let paddingRemover = PaddingRemoverUsingTrimming()\n        let id3FrameConfiguration = ID3FrameConfiguration()\n        return [\n            .Artist: ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.artist = frameContentWithoutPadding\n            },\n            .AlbumArtist: ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.albumArtist = frameContentWithoutPadding\n            },\n            .Album: ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.album = frameContentWithoutPadding\n            },\n            .Title: ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.title = frameContentWithoutPadding\n            },\n            .AttachedPicture: AttachedPictureFrameContentParsingOperation(\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration,\n                    pictureTypeAdapter: ID3PictureTypeAdapter(\n                            id3FrameConfiguration: ID3FrameConfiguration(),\n                            id3AttachedPictureFrameConfiguration: ID3AttachedPictureFrameConfiguration()\n                    )\n            ),\n            .Year: ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.year = frameContentWithoutPadding\n            },\n            .Genre: ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.genre = ID3GenreStringAdapter().adapt(genre: frameContentWithoutPadding)\n            },\n            .TrackPosition : ID3FrameStringContentParsingOperation(\n                    paddingRemover: paddingRemover,\n                    id3FrameConfiguration: id3FrameConfiguration\n            ) { (id3Tag: ID3Tag, frameContentWithoutPadding: String) in\n                id3Tag.trackPosition = ID3TrackPositionStringAdapter().adapt(trackPosition: frameContentWithoutPadding)\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's see instead how ID3TagEditor write a new tag to an mp3 file. The creation of the tag is done by\nthe `ID3TagCreator` class used inside the `Mp3WithID3TagBuilder` class, the one that execute the real write on the mp3\nfile with the new tag on disk. The main function of the `ID3TagCreator` class is `create(id3Tag: ID3Tag) throws -> Data`\n. Inside this function the frames are created from the data passed to the framework as an `ID3Tag` class. If all the the\nframe validation goes well a new tag header is created and again, if the tag header is valid (the size of the tag is\nvalid), a new `Data` object is returned to the `Mp3WithID3TagBuilder` class and is written to the mp3 file.\n\n```swift\nclass ID3TagCreator {\n    private let id3FrameCreatorsChain: ID3FrameCreatorsChain\n    private let uInt32ToByteArrayAdapter: UInt32ToByteArrayAdapter\n    private let id3TagConfiguration: ID3TagConfiguration\n\n    ....\n\n    func create(id3Tag: ID3Tag) throws -> Data {\n        var frames = id3FrameCreatorsChain.createFrames(id3Tag: id3Tag, tag: [UInt8]())\n        if thereIsNotValidDataIn(frames: frames) {\n            throw ID3TagEditorError.InvalidTagData\n        }\n        frames.append(contentsOf: createFramesEnd())\n        let header = createTagHeader(contentSize: frames.count, id3Tag: id3Tag);\n        let tag = header + frames\n        if (isTooBig(tag: tag)) {\n            throw ID3TagEditorError.TagTooBig\n        }\n        return Data(bytes: tag)\n    }\n\n    ....\n}\n```\n\nHow are the frames data created? The answer is inside the `ID3FrameCreatorsChain` and the `ID3FrameCreatorsChainFactory`\nclasses. The factory class creates a [**Chain of responsibility**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern \"chain of responsibility\"), where each\nsubclass of the `ID3FrameCreatorsChain` class is a specialization with the responsibility to write a specific frame\ntype. At the end of the chain an `[Uint8]` array is returned. This is basically an array of bytes, that is then\nconverted into a `Data` object at the end of the `create(id3Tag: ID3Tag) throws -> Data` of the `ID3TagCreator` class (\nwhere also the tag header is added as we saw before). Below you can find the chain creation contained in\nthe `ID3FrameCreatorsChainFactory` class (again, we will see the details of the various classes contained in the chain\nin other future posts :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: This framework contains too much cool swift stuff :flushed:). One\nimportant thing to note: the `ID3AttachedPicturesFramesCreator` class is able to create attached picture frames that\nsets the type of the cover to one from the list defined in the ID3 standard. In this way I can use\nmy [ID3TagEditor framework to tag the mp3 with the correct data that I need to display the mp3 files cover on the media nav system of my clio](/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/ \"born mo3id3tagger id3tageditor\")!!! :\nrelieved:\n\n```swift\nclass ID3FrameCreatorsChainFactory {\n    static func make() -> ID3FrameCreatorsChain {\n        let paddingAdder = PaddingAdderToEndOfContentUsingNullChar()\n        let frameConfiguration = ID3FrameConfiguration()\n        let uInt32ToByteArrayAdapter = UInt32ToByteArrayAdapterUsingUnsafePointer()\n        let frameContentSizeCalculator = ID3FrameContentSizeCalculator(\n                uInt32ToByteArrayAdapter: uInt32ToByteArrayAdapter\n        )\n        let frameFlagsCreator = ID3FrameFlagsCreator()\n        let frameFromStringUTF16ContentCreator = ID3FrameFromStringContentCreator(\n                frameContentSizeCalculator: frameContentSizeCalculator,\n                frameFlagsCreator: frameFlagsCreator,\n                stringToBytesAdapter: ID3UTF16StringToByteAdapter(paddingAdder: paddingAdder,\n                                                                  frameConfiguration: frameConfiguration)\n        )\n        let frameFromStringISO88591ContentCreator = ID3FrameFromStringContentCreator(\n            frameContentSizeCalculator: frameContentSizeCalculator,\n            frameFlagsCreator: frameFlagsCreator,\n            stringToBytesAdapter: ID3ISO88591StringToByteAdapter(paddingAdder: paddingAdder,\n                                                                 frameConfiguration: frameConfiguration)\n        )\n        let albumFrameCreator = ID3AlbumFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringUTF16ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        let albumArtistCreator = ID3AlbumArtistFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringUTF16ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        let artistFrameCreator = ID3ArtistFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringUTF16ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        let titleFrameCreator = ID3TitleFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringUTF16ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        let attachedPictureFrameCreator = ID3AttachedPicturesFramesCreator(\n                attachedPictureFrameCreator: ID3AttachedPictureFrameCreator(\n                        id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration,\n                        id3AttachedPictureFrameConfiguration: ID3AttachedPictureFrameConfiguration(),\n                        frameContentSizeCalculator: frameContentSizeCalculator,\n                        frameFlagsCreator: frameFlagsCreator\n                )\n        )\n        let yearFrameCreator = ID3YearFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringISO88591ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        let genreFrameCreator = ID3GenreFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringISO88591ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        let trackPositionFrameCreator = ID3TrackPositionFrameCreator(\n                frameCreator: frameFromStringISO88591ContentCreator,\n                id3FrameConfiguration: frameConfiguration\n        )\n        albumFrameCreator.nextCreator = albumArtistCreator\n        albumArtistCreator.nextCreator = artistFrameCreator\n        artistFrameCreator.nextCreator = titleFrameCreator\n        titleFrameCreator.nextCreator = yearFrameCreator\n        yearFrameCreator.nextCreator = genreFrameCreator\n        genreFrameCreator.nextCreator = trackPositionFrameCreator\n        trackPositionFrameCreator.nextCreator = attachedPictureFrameCreator\n        return albumFrameCreator\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it!!!

There was not a\nsingle line in the Xcode log that was pointing us to the right solution.\n\nWe tried to:\n\n- debug the REST services, to understand if there was a bug in the API\n- debug the Network Client code, to understand if there were some errors in the deserialization of the JSON or in the image download\n- debug the UI, to understand if we were making mistakes with the Image display code.\n\nDuring the investigation we noticed that both the images bundled inside the extension\n(e.g. the one shown in the widget picker before installing it) and the ones downloaded from the API were not working.\nWe were able to replicate the issue only on iPhone 11 (A13 Bionic Chip) and older.\n\nWe finally checked the general system log using the Console.app, to better understand what was happening at system level.\nTo avoid having noise in the logs, we created and empty app project with attached our widget extension.\nWhile running the test app on an iPhone 11, we finally found the problem.\n\n![Debugging the code with Console.app](../images/posts/debugger-widget.png)\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot, the widget was failing to archive because the image used as background (what we\ncalled inspiration image in the previous posts) was too big. This was causing a memory leak\n(see `CGImageCopyResourceImageSource` logs) that prevented the code from opening the images causing\nthe \"broken widget\" state reported above.  \nAfter some searches we found [this thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/710745) on the Apple Developer Forum,\nwhere they were suggesting to reduce images' size using some UIImage extension code.\n\n_So how did we solve the problem?_ We simply sized our images in the right way :laughing:.  \nUsing the [WidgetKit Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/system-experiences/widgets/#specifications)\nfrom Apple, we gave to the images the size based on the width of the widgets on the various iPhones.\nIf you can't approach the problem in this way, you can still use the extension code for UIImage mentioned\nin the Apple Developer Forum above.\n\n```swift\nextension UIImage {\n  func resized(toWidth width: CGFloat, isOpaque: Bool = true) -> UIImage? {\n    let canvas = CGSize(width: width, height: CGFloat(ceil(width/size.width * size.height)))\n    let format = imageRendererFormat\n    format.opaque = isOpaque\n    return UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: canvas, format: format).image {\n      _ in draw(in: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: canvas))\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe journey into WidgetKit during our FriYaY is not finished yet, and we are planning to introduce more new features \nin the near future, sooo stay tuned!!! :heart:  \n","slug":"/2023/01/10/widget-ios-swiftui-image-problem/","description":"Discover how we had a long day debugging WidgetKit problems with images.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni","marco-de-lucchi"]},"9e287375-3a06-5bd2-beb7-c8fdd27d4369":{"title":"Clean Code: functions","content":"\n*Let's learn how to write function in a clean way.*\n\n---\n\nIn a previous post I talked about [clean code](/2018/04/25/clean-code-objects-data-structures-law-demeter/) and how\nmuch it is important to me. In this new post I will talk about another topic of the uncle bob clean code book:\nfunctions.  \nHow can we have write a good function/method? This is the list of the features that a function must have to be\nconsidered \"good\":\n\n* Small\n* Do one thing\n* Have no side effects\n* One level of abstraction\n* Use descriptive names\n* Low number of arguments\n* Command Query Separation\n* Prefer exception to error Codes\n* \"Don't repeat yourself\"\n\nLet's go deeper in the details of each one of these features.\n\n#### **Small**\n\nWhat does Uncle Bob mean when he talks about \"small\" functions? How much small must be a function to be considered \"\nsmall\" in the clean code dictionary? Let's take a quote from his book *clean code*:\n\n> In the eighties we used to say that a function should be no bigger than a screen-full. Of course we said that at a time when VT100 screens were 24 lines by 80 columns, and our editors used 4 lines for administrative purposes. Nowadays with a cranked-down font and a nice big monitor, you can fit 150 characters on a line and a 100 lines or more on a screen. Lines should not be 150 characters long. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.\n\nHonestly I think that also 20 lines are already too much. You must consider that most of the automated code quality\ntools available on the market consider a function of 20 lines too much long by default. Sometimes you will be tempted to\nbreak this rule :grin:, but remember: smaller functions will always be more readable. To write such small function you\nhave to follow some simple rules:\n\n* the body of every `if else` must be of one line (most of the time a call to another function)\n* the body of every `for` loop must be of one line (most of the time a call to another function)\n* the body of every `while` loop must be of one line (most of the time a call to another function)\n* no nested structure\n\n#### **Do one thing**\n\nThis is simple: function should do just one and only one thing. Uncle Bob wrote this phrase in his book:\n\n> FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.\n\nBut wait: how can we be sure that a function does just one thing? :cold_sweat: Our function doesn't do just one thing If\nwe can extract other functions with a name and an implementation that is not a restatement of the implementation of the\ncurrent function.\n\n#### **One level of abstraction**\n\nOur function must contains instruction that are at the same level of abstraction. Every instruction in a function must\nexpress a concept at the same level of the others contained in it. This basically means that we will have\nfunction/method with higher concept at the top level of our classes/programs, and by going deeper in the source code we\nwill find functions/methods with lower concepts. This top-down relation between higher-lower level concept is called **\nThe stepdown rule**. Uncle Bob described this rule very well (and it is basically a remark of the concept expressed in\nthis paragraph):\n\n> We want the code to read like a top-down narrative. We want every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions. I call this The Stepdown Rule. To say this differently, we want to be able to read the program as though it were a set of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current level of abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level down.\n\n#### **Have no side effects**\n\nThis is a consequence of the fact that our function should **do one thing**: our function should not generate side\neffects when it is executed. In particular our functions should not:\n\n* create temporal coupling with other function by silently modifying states/other properties\n* use output arguments (inout parameters)\n\n#### **Use descriptive names**\n\nThis feature for \"clean function\" it is strictly correlated to my previous\npost [clean code: meaningful names](/2017/09/11/clean-code-meaningful-names/ \"clean code meaningful names\"). There's\none more thing that it is import to note: the most of the IDE available on the market today let the developer speed up\ntheir writing abilities with a lot of autocomplete and refactoring features (check out\nmy [previous article](/2018/01/16/ide-refactoring-android-studio-xcode-appcode-webstorm-jetbrains/ \"xcode android studio refactoring\")\nto better understand what I mean). So don't be afraid and use very long and expressive functions/methods name. Your code\nwill really become like a beautiful poem to read :heart_eyes:.\n\n#### **Low number of arguments**\n\nHow much arguments should a perfect clean code function have? zero :expressionless::laughing:. Then we could have\nmonadic (1 argument), dyadic (2 arguments) or triads (3 arguments) functions. Functions with more than 3 arguments\nshould be avoided whenever possible. When the number of arguments start to growth to more than 3 arguments it is\npossible wrap them in specific class that describe better their meaning. This kind of classes are called argument\nobjects. For example Uncle Bob shown us a beautiful example in his book, where he rewrote a factory method to create a\ncircle using arguments objects. Let's see his code snippet:\n\n```java\n/// Simple version\nCircle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius);\n\n/// With arguments objects\nCircle makeCircle(Point center, double radius);\n```  \n\nDo you see how much more readable and clear it is the second version of the `makeCircle` function? Yes, I can see it :\nsunglasses:\n\n#### **Command Query Separation**\n\nLet's see what Uncle Bob says about the command query separation:\n\n> Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion.\n\nI think there's nothing else to ad to this point :stuck_out_tongue:.\n\n#### **Prefer exception to error Codes**\n\nThis is a feature strictly related to languages that supports exceptions. Generally speaking if you need to return an\nerror to a user of your class, try to avoid as much as possible error code. Always use exceptions whenever possible. In\nthis way the user of your class will not abuse of nested if cases to check returned error code from your functions.\n\n#### **\"Don't repeat yourself\"**\n\n> Duplication may be the root of all evil in software.\n\nThis quote from Uncle Bob's book is more expressive than any other explanation. Developers can choose from a wide range\nof programming techniques to avoid duplication in their code. Generally speaking duplication make your code hard to\nmaintain, because often you need to propagate an a modification for a new feature in a lot of different places. We can\nclose this section with another quote from Uncle Bob that I think it is quite interesting:\n\n> It would appear that since the invention of the subroutine, innovations in software development have been an ongoing attempt to eliminate duplication from our source code.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nThat's all for Uncle Bob and functions. If you didn't read yet Uncle Bob \"Clean Code\" book it's time to catch up the gap\nand get a copy for yourself :sparkling_heart:.\n","slug":"/2019/07/28/clean-code-functions/","description":"Let's learn how to write function in a clean way.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"9e9bf5a5-d069-534f-a9f3-cc5f9addeb4b":{"title":"Add dark mode support on your website with SASS and prefers-color-scheme media query","content":"\n*Dark mode support has been around for quite some time. Let's see how you can create a light theme and a dark theme for\nyour website that will be selected automatically based on the user system preference.*\n\n---\n\nDark mode has been around for a while on all the major platforms: macOS, iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows\nand [now also Linux](https://itsfoss.com/dark-mode-ubuntu/ \"linux dark mode\"). Well, aside from the discussion to decide\nif [dark mode is better for your eyes of not](https://www.quora.com/Is-dark-mode-light-text-on-a-dark-background-really-better-for-the-eyes)\n, it's clear that it gives you a big style improvement on your site.  \nSo it's a perfect time to add a Dark theme to your website that will be used as soon as your users use dark mode on\ntheir system!!! This is why I decided to add dark mode to this site. Let's see how I did this by leveraging the power of\nsass mixins and media queries.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nFirst of all I needed to understand how it was possible to detect system appearance setting. It turns our this is really\nsimple thanks to the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. At the moment of this writing this media query\nis [supported by all the major browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=prefers-color-scheme). It accepts three values:\n\n* no-preference, indicates that the user has made no preference known to the system (default to light usually)\n* light, the user has expressed the preference for a page that has a light theme (dark text on light background).\n* dark Indicates that user has expressed the preference for a page that has a dark theme (light text on dark background)\n  .\n\nSo I needed to define a strategy to write the CSS in a way that the user will see the dark theme only if the system\nappearance is set to dark mode and fallback to the light theme for all the other cases. This is why I chose to define a\nmedia query only for the `dark` value of the `prefers-color-scheme` and keep the light theme values defined in the base\nCSS rules. So all the theme related rules will look like the following CSS code block.\n\n```css\n.a-rule {\n    background-color: #FFFFFF;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    .a-rule {\n        background-color: #000000;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn my project I'm using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), a language that extends CSS enables you to use things like\nvariables, nested rules, inline imports and more. So I wanted to find a way to write something in which I centralized\nthis logic. In this way I will have a theme section in my sass source code that has the only responsibility to manage\nthe theme for the entire website. This is possible in SASS by using `@mixin` and `@include`!! :heart_eyes: Let's see the\ndefinition from the official documentation.\n\n> Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They are defined using the `@mixin` at-rule. A mixin’s name can be any Sass identifier, and it can contain any statement other than top-level statements. They can be used to encapsulate styles that can be dropped into a single style rule; they can contain style rules of their own that can be nested in other rules or included at the top level of the stylesheet; or they can just serve to modify variables...Mixins are included into the current context using the `@include` at-rule, which is written `@include <name>` or `@include <name>(<arguments...>)`, with the name of the mixin being included.\n\nThis is exactly what I needed to create my \"SASS theme manager\". Let's see some code. First of all I defined a list of\nkeys that identify:\n\n* the theme names\n* the colors contained in each of my themes.\n\n```scss\n$dark-theme: \"dark-theme\";\n$light-theme: \"light-theme\";\n\n$primary-color-dark: \"primary-color-dark\";\n$primary-color: \"primary-color\";\n$primary-color-light: \"primary-color-light\";\n$primary-color-text: \"primary-color-text\";\n$accent-color: \"accent-color\";\n$primary-text-color: \"primary-text-color\";\n$secondary-text-color: \"secondary-text-color\";\n$divider-color: \"divider-color\";\n$general-background: \"general-background\";\n$general-background-light: \"general-background-light\";\n/* ...other color variable strings... */\n```\n\nThen I created a new variable named `$themes` associated with\na [SASS map](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps) data structure. This map contains as key the two theme\nname variables, `$dark-theme` and `$light-theme`, and the content is again a map with the association between color\nnames (the variables defined above) and the color HEX value.\n\n```scss\n$themes: (\n        $light-theme: (\n                $primary-color-dark: #303F9F,\n                $primary-color: #3F51B5,\n                $primary-color-light: #DFDFF1,\n                $primary-color-text: #FFFFFF,\n                $accent-color: #0F67FF,\n                $primary-text-color: #151515,\n                $secondary-text-color: #575757,\n                $divider-color: #BDBDBD,\n                $general-background: #FAFAFA,\n                $general-background-light: #FFFFFF,\n          /* ...other color keys with HEX values... */\n        ),\n        $dark-theme: (\n                $primary-color-dark: #303F9F,\n                $primary-color: #3F51B5,\n                $primary-color-light: #DFDFF1,\n                $primary-color-text: #FFFFFF,\n                $accent-color: #4fA7ff,\n                $primary-text-color: #d7d7d8,\n                $secondary-text-color: #A6A6A6,\n                $divider-color: #575757,\n                $general-background: #181918,\n                $general-background-light: #363636,\n          /* ...other color keys with HEX values... */\n        )\n);\n```\n\nNow I was ready to define the `@mixin` needed to apply the themes. We said in the introduction that we will apply the\ndark mode based on the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query and we will use the light theme as default (\nlight theme or no user preference). This basically means that I needed to define a `@mixin` that let us apply a certain\nproperty in both cases. I needed also to be able to eventually apply other property attributes other than the color\nbased on the current theme selected. For example I had rules for border styling like `border: 1px solid #BDBDBD` where\nthe color must be picked up from the correct theme based on the rule discussed before. So I\ncreated `@mixin theme($themes, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront: false, $additionalProperties: '')`\nthat accepts the following properties:\n\n* `$property`, the property that we want to change based on the theme selected for the current user\n* `$color`, the color name to be picked up. This should be one of the variable seen above\n* `$additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront`, a boolean that is used to understand if the additional properties to be\n  concatenated with the color values should be placed before or after the color value. This property is optional and has\n  a default value of false\n* `$additionalProperties`, a string with the list of properties be concatenated with the color value. This property is\n  optional and has a default value of empty string.\n\nIn this theme mixin I got the dark and light theme values by extracting theme from the `$themes` variable using\nthe `map-get` [SASS map function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map \"sass map function\"). Then I used\nanother\nmixin `@mixin themeProperty($theme, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties)` to\ncreate the css rule `<property>: <value>` using the values received from the invocation. Inside it I did the\nconcatenation between the additional properties and the color value (if necessary) using the `+` operator and\nthe [SASS unquote function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/string \"sass unquote function\") to remove the\nstring quote and have in output from the mixin a standard css rule. The `themeProperty` is invoked two times, one for\nthe default value with the light time, and another one inside the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` query. Below you\ncan find the code of these two new mixin.\n\n```scss\n@mixin themeProperty($theme, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties) {\n  @if $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront {\n    #{$property}: unquote($additionalProperties + ' ' + map-get($theme, $color));\n  } @else {\n    #{$property}: unquote(map-get($theme, $color) + ' ' + $additionalProperties);\n  }\n}\n\n@mixin theme($property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront: false, $additionalProperties: '') {\n  $light: map-get($themes, $light-theme);\n  $dark: map-get($themes, $dark-theme);\n\n  @include themeProperty($light, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties);\n\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    @include themeProperty($dark, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is all I needed two generate the CSS rules with the theme selection based on the appearance user preferences. Below\nyou can find the entire implementation described above (I removed some color names from the list because it is too big\nand not so useful).\n\n```scss\n$dark-theme: \"dark-theme\";\n$light-theme: \"light-theme\";\n\n$primary-color-dark: \"primary-color-dark\";\n$primary-color: \"primary-color\";\n$primary-color-light: \"primary-color-light\";\n$primary-color-text: \"primary-color-text\";\n$accent-color: \"accent-color\";\n$primary-text-color: \"primary-text-color\";\n$secondary-text-color: \"secondary-text-color\";\n$divider-color: \"divider-color\";\n$general-background: \"general-background\";\n$general-background-light: \"general-background-light\";\n/* ...other color keys... */\n\n$themes: (\n        $light-theme: (\n                $primary-color-dark: #303F9F,\n                $primary-color: #3F51B5,\n                $primary-color-light: #DFDFF1,\n                $primary-color-text: #FFFFFF,\n                $accent-color: #0F67FF,\n                $primary-text-color: #151515,\n                $secondary-text-color: #575757,\n                $divider-color: #BDBDBD,\n                $general-background: #FAFAFA,\n                $general-background-light: #FFFFFF,\n          /* ...other color keys with HEX values... */\n        ),\n        $dark-theme: (\n                $primary-color-dark: #303F9F,\n                $primary-color: #3F51B5,\n                $primary-color-light: #DFDFF1,\n                $primary-color-text: #FFFFFF,\n                $accent-color: #4fA7ff,\n                $primary-text-color: #d7d7d8,\n                $secondary-text-color: #A6A6A6,\n                $divider-color: #575757,\n                $general-background: #181918,\n                $general-background-light: #363636,\n          /* ...other color keys with HEX values... */\n        )\n);\n\n@mixin themeProperty($theme, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties) {\n  @if $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront {\n    #{$property}: unquote($additionalProperties + ' ' + map-get($theme, $color));\n  } @else {\n    #{$property}: unquote(map-get($theme, $color) + ' ' + $additionalProperties);\n  }\n}\n\n@mixin theme($property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront: false, $additionalProperties: '') {\n  $light: map-get($themes, $light-theme);\n  $dark: map-get($themes, $dark-theme);\n\n  @include themeProperty($light, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties);\n\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    @include themeProperty($dark, $property, $color, $additionalPropertiesPositionIsFront, $additionalProperties);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith all the stuff above I was ready to \"themify\" my web site. All I needed to do (and if you read the article until\nhere you're ready too :smile:) was to call the `theme` mixin in my styles definition in order to apply the theme color\nwhere I needed them. Below you can find an example where I'm setting the text color in a css class.\n\n```scss\n.blog-post-meta {\n  @include theme('color', $secondary-text-color);\n  /*... other rules ...*/\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nNowadays it is important to give to the user the best experience when they use your software. Dark mode is another step\nin this direction. By leveraging the power of tools like SASS you can implement a theme component in less then a hour.\nSooo now go and join the dark side (of themes). :hearts:\n","slug":"/2020/05/20/dark-mode-css-sass-scss/","description":"Dark mode support has been around for quite some time.

In particular we chose to use the Appium implementation based on:\n    * JavaScript, to be able to write our tests with a language with similar features\n      to [TypeScript, the language we are using with React Native for our apps](/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/ \"TypeScript React Native\")\n    * [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/ \"webdriverio\"), JavaScript implementation of the Selenium 2.0 WebDriver API\n    * [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha \"mocha test framework\"), a JavaScript testing framework\n    * [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel \"babel es6\"), a compiler for writing next generation JavaScript\n    * [Appium XCUITest Driver](https://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/ios-xcuitest/index.html \"appium ios driver\") for iOS\n    * [Appium UiAutomator Driver](https://appium.io/docs/en/drivers/android-uiautomator2/index.html \"appium android driver\")\n      for Android\n    * [Appium desktop App](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop)\n\n#### **Development**\n\nThe first thing we did was installing all the software stack previously described on our CI machine. As a consequence of\nthe fact that we want to run tests for both iOS and Android a macOS based CI machine is needed (because you need to\ninstall Xcode). Fortunately, our CI machine was already an Apple Computer so we didn't need to change anything.  \nAfter that we created a new javascript project, that follows the structure of\nthe [WebdriverIO sample code contained in the Appium github repository](https://github.com/appium/appium/tree/master/sample-code/javascript-webdriverio \"appium webdriverio sample\")\n. This sample project is written using ES5 syntax, so we decided to upgrade it to use ES6 syntax and compile it using\nBabel. This is possible by launching mocha and specifying babel as the compiler. This is the final command to launch our\ntests:\n\n```shell\nmocha --compilers js:babel-core/register --timeout 6000000 test\n```\n\nThis is the final `package.json` with all the dependencies and scripts phases.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"e2e-tests\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"e2e tests\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"pretest\": \"./download-artifacts.sh\",\n    \"test\": \"mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register --timeout 6000000 test\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"Fabrizio Duroni\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"assert\": \"^1.4.1\",\n    \"babel-core\": \"^6.26.3\",\n    \"babel-preset-env\": \"^1.7.0\",\n    \"babel-plugin-transform-runtime\": \"^6.23.0\",\n    \"chai\": \"^4.1.2\",\n    \"mocha\": \"^5.0.0\",\n    \"webdriverio\": \"^4.12.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is the `.babelrc` file used to configure the babel compiler. The `transform-runtime` plugin is needed in order to\nbe able to use arrow functions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    \"env\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"transform-runtime\",\n      {\n        \"polyfill\": false,\n        \"regenerator\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAs you may already notice from the `package.json` file above, there's a `pretest` phase that launches a script\ncalled `download-artifacts.sh`. This a custom script we added to download the latest release of our iOS ipa and Android\napk artifacts. This will be the apps installed on the iOS simulators/Android emulators and tested with appium.  \nAfter that we created the iOS and Android appium config to be used by our tests.\n\n```javascript\nimport path from \"path\";\n\nconst iOSConfig = {\n  protocol: \"http\",\n  host: \"localhost\",\n  port: 4723,\n  path: \"/wd/hub\",\n  logLevel: \"verbose\",\n  desiredCapabilities: {\n    platformName: \"iOS\",\n    automationName: \"XCUITest\",\n    deviceName: \"iPhone 8\",\n    platformVersion: \"11.4\",\n    clearSystemFiles: true,\n    wdaStartupRetryInterval: 1000,\n    useNewWDA: true,\n    waitForQuiescence: false,\n    shouldUseSingletonTestManager: false,\n    app: path.resolve(__dirname, \"..\", \"apps\", \"<ipa downloaded using pretest download.sh script>\"),\n    orientation: \"PORTRAIT\",\n  }\n};\n\nconst androidConfig = {\n  host: \"localhost\",\n  port: 4723,\n  logLevel: \"verbose\",\n  desiredCapabilities: {\n    platformName: \"Android\",\n    automationName: \"UiAutomator2\",\n    deviceName: \"Pixel_XL_API_27\",\n    platformVersion: \"8.1\",\n    app: path.resolve(__dirname, \"..\", \"apps\", \"<apk downloaded using pretest download.sh script>\")\n  }\n};\n\nexport { iOSConfig, androidConfig }\n```\n\nOne important thing to note about the configuration above is that for iOS we were forced to set the following four\noptions:\n\n```javascript\nwdaStartupRetryInterval: 1000,\nuseNewWDA: true,\nwaitForQuiescence: false,\nshouldUseSingletonTestManager: false,\n```\n\nThese were need in order to avoid a [know bug in appium for iOS](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/9645) that\ncauses the appium test suite to get stuck during the creation of the appium WebdriverIO session. After the configuration\nsetup we were ready to write our first tests. To write them we used\nthe [Appium desktop app](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop \"Appium desktop app\") to record the interfaction with\nour apps. The outcome of the recording is a test source code written in the language + driver you prefer (in our case\nJavaScript + WebdriverIO). Remember that appium uses the accessibility id on iOS and the content-desc on Android to\nunify the search method for both platform. If this fields are not setted correctly with the UI elements you interact\nwith, the appium desktop app will generate a XPath queries for XCUITest or UiAutomator. This will cause you to write two\ntests with the same interaction just to change the UI elements identifier (or write some wrapper with parametrized\nUIElements). So the best solution to have appium works correctly is to set the fields above with the same values on both\niOS and Android.  \nAfter that we launched the appium server on the CI machine previously configured and we created a new Jenkins job that\nclones the `e2e-tests` project and runs the command:\n\n```shell\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis job is automatically triggered (cron) every day at 8 PM. That's it!!! This is how we tested our apps with Appium.\nThat's all for appium and mobile end to end tests.

Today I will show you how to achieve the same result for tan Android Apps. I will a\npart of the Android SDK called `JavascriptInterface`.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nI will use the same simple I used in the previous post for iOS. The html page contains a form with 2 input fields and a\nbutton. We want to be able to read the form data inserted when the user clicks on the button and do some action on the\nJava code side. In this sample case we will show a simple `AlertDialog` that contains the form data. Let's start by\nsetting up the `Activity` that will display the form, `MainActivity`. The first thing to do is to setup the `WebView` by\ndeclaring it in the activity layout. After that we can already setup the code that will load the web page in\nthe `onCreate` method of the `MainActivity`.\n\n```java\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    @SuppressLint({\"SetJavaScriptEnabled\", \"AddJavascriptInterface\"})\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        WebView formWebView = findViewById(R.id.webview);\n        formWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\n        formWebView.addJavascriptInterface(new FormJavascriptInterface(this), \"Android\");\n        formWebView.loadUrl(\"file:///android_asset/form.html\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe important thing to note in the code above is the\ncall `formWebView.addJavascriptInterface(new FormJavascriptInterface(this), \"Android\");`. By calling this method we are\ncreating on the `window` global javascript variable a new object called `Android`. I will be able to use it by\ncalling `window.Android.<some method>`. Where are this method declared? As you can see the first parameter of the\nmethod `addJavascriptInterface` is an object called `FormJavascriptInterface`. This class contains a method\nnamed `showUser` annotated with `@JavascriptInterface`. This annotation enable the Android SDK to expose this method to\nthe `window.Android` object exposed on the web side.\n\n```java\npublic class FormJavascriptInterface {\n    private Context context;\n\n    FormJavascriptInterface(Context context) {\n        this.context = context;\n    }\n\n    @JavascriptInterface\n    public void showUser(String name, String email) {\n        new AlertDialog.Builder(context)\n                .setTitle(\"User\")\n                .setMessage(name + \" \" + email)\n                .show();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo as you can imagine now I'm able to call the method `showUser` inside the html page loaded in the `WebView`. Let's see\nthe final implementation of the web page.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" />\n  <title>ExploreWKWebViewJavascript</title>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    function submitForm() {\n      Android.showUser(document.getElementById(\"name\").value, document.getElementById(\"email\").value);\n    }\n  </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div>\n  <h2>Enter your data:</h2>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n    <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter email\" name=\"email\">\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n    <input type=\"value\" id=\"name\" placeholder=\"Enter name\" name=\"name\">\n  </div>\n  <button onclick=\"submitForm()\">Click me</button>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAs you can see in the submit form we are calling the method we saw before annotated `@JavascriptInterface`. The\nparameter are passed as a normal JavaScript call.  \nYou can find the complete code example in\nthis [github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Explore-JavascriptInterfaces \"github repository\").\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe `JavascriptInterface` is really powerful. It lets you implement a deeper web to native integration that could\nsignificantly improve the general user experiences. `JavascriptInterface`, the best web to native integration for :\nrobot: Android :robot:.\n","slug":"/2019/09/06/html-javascript-to-native-communication-android/","description":"Javascript Interface can be helpful when you need to call native code from a webview on Android.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"b2a12992-4d82-5e2d-b530-d5f1122f51c5":{"title":"Blender tutorial: light - part 1","content":"\n*In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about light.*\n\n---\n\nIn the [previous post of the series \"Blender tutorial\"](/2019/03/23/blender-tutorial-9-textures-part-2/) we talked\nabout textures in Blender. In this post we will explore lights in Blender.  \nFirst of all we need to clarify one thing: lights in Blender are called lamps. So in all menus and option we will find\nthat word to identify lights.  \nTo add a light to our scenes, just use the option Add -> Lamp and select one of the light type available. Let's add for\nexample a simple point light.\n\n![Add a light to the scene](../images/posts/blender-add-light.jpg)\n\nWe can then customize the light properties using the related tab in the properties panel. In this section you can find\nspecific customizable properties for each type of light. For example for a point light we can customize:\n\n* the falloff of the light, so how the light decrease when you get away from it\n* negative, to transform the light so that it will subtract illumination from the scene\n* diffuse and specular, so that the light will be used to render only specular or diffuse component of a material\n* energy, how much bright the light is\n* distance, the maximum light distance at which it will still affect objects\n\n![Point light properties panel](../images/posts/blender-point-light.jpg)\n\nFor the point light (and also some other kind of light) it is possible to enable shadows. To do that we have to choose\nray shadow in the light properties panel and customize the look and feel of the shadow. Here we can also define the\nnumber of samples to be used to generate the shadows: the higher the better shadow we obtain (if you want to know more\nabout ray tracing shadows, you can\nread [this lecture](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/557/19-slides.pdf \"ray tracing shadow rays\"). To actually render\nthe shadow, we need also to set the shadow flag enable in the renderer settings properties panel.\n\n![Shadow panel properties](../images/posts/blender-shadow-enable-1.jpg)\n\n![Enable shadow in the shading section](../images/posts/blender-shadow-enable-2.jpg)\n\nThere are other types of lights. For example we have spot lamps. These are light with a specific dim that simulate a\ncone of light. We can customize its properties in the light tab in the properties panel. One thing to note for spot\nlight is that we can customize the cone (shape, size...).\n\n![A spot light](../images/posts/blender-spot-light.jpg)\n\nSpot light can use a new type of shadow called buffer shadow. They are useful because they can be rendered more quickly.\nAfter enabling it in the properties panel of the spot light, we can customize it as always. There are different type of\nbuffer shadow:\n\n* Classical\n* Classical Half\n* Irregular, a method to achieve ray-tracing alike shadows with good performance\n* Deep, another method similar to ray tracing but much more expensive in terms of performance then Irregular\n\n![Add shadow to a spot light](../images/posts/blender-spot-light-shadow.jpg)\n\nAnother type of light is Hemi-lamps. This are used to create an overall directional light for you scene. As a\nconsequence of the fact that it is a directional light, the position of it doesn't change the final lighting result.\nOnly the orientation influences the final lighting result. As always, we can customize its behaviour in the properties\npanel.\n\n![A hemi lamps](../images/posts/blender-hemi-lamps.jpg)\n\nThe last available type of light is the area lamps. This kind of light provide illumination from a specific region\nrather than a single point or a single direction. We can customize it as always from the properties panel. One important\nthing to note is that area light as a distance property instead of falloff. This parameter determines the final\nattenuation result. the distance is represented in the 3D window as a dashed line. The only type of shadow supported the\nray traced shadow. We can also customize the shape of the shadow: different shapes influence the final rendering result.\n\n![An area lamps](../images/posts/blender-area-lamps.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will talk about how to do other cool stuff with lights in Blender.\n","slug":"/2019/03/24/blender-tutorial-10-light-part-1/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about light.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"b567f722-46c6-5e78-a130-76992063a7fc":{"title":"A first approach to contract test","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about contract test: what they are and how you can use them.*\n\n---\n\nSometimes you have to unit test multiple implementations of the same interface. Basically you have the same tests for\nmultiple concrete implementation of the same interface. In a case like this one, contract test could help you save a lot\nof time. By using contract test you will be able to run the same set of tests for different concrete implementations.  \nHow does it work? The main point is to have a template base abstract \"ContractTest\" test class that incapsulate the\nlogic of the tests using abstract methods that use the base interface of the objects under test. These abstract methods\nwill be implemented in the subclasses of this \"ContractTest\" class and they will feed the test with a concrete\nimplementation of the interface used in the declaration of the abstract methods.  \nLet's see an example to make everything more clear!!!  \nThe example is a standalone Java project that uses JUnit 4 and Mockito 2.8. Obviously, you can apply this concept to\nother languages/platform (in fact, I learned and implemented contract test while I was developing a new feature inside\nan Android App :heart_eyes:).  \nSuppose for example that we have the following interface:\n\n```java\npublic interface Command {\n    void execute();\n}\n```\n\nWe have two objects that implement that interface: AccountCommand and SettingsCommand.\n\n```java\nclass AccountCommand implements Command {\n    private MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener;\n\n    AccountCommand(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener) {\n        this.menuActionsListener = menuActionsListener;\n    }\n\n    public void execute() {\n        menuActionsListener.onAccountSelected();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SettingsCommand implements Command {\n    private MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener;\n\n    SettingsCommand(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener) {\n        this.menuActionsListener = menuActionsListener;\n    }\n\n    public void execute() {\n        menuActionsListener.onSettingsSelected();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see the two implementations look very similar. So it's time to see how contract test can help us :metal:!!\nWe can write a `CommandContract` base test class that contains the logic of the test we want to write. In our specific\ncase we want to assure that when a command is executed, by calling the `execute()` method, the `menuActionsListener` is\ncalled with the correct method on each concrete implementation of `Command`. So our `CommandContract` implementation is:\n\n```java\nabstract class CommandContract {\n    private Command command;\n    private MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener;\n\n    @Test\n    public void commandIsExecuted() throws Exception {\n        givenAMenuActionListener();\n        command = givenACommand(menuActionsListener);\n        whenACommandIsExecuted();\n        thenTheCorrectMenuActionIsInvoked(menuActionsListener);\n    }\n\n    private void givenAMenuActionListener() {\n        menuActionsListener = mock(MenuActionsListener.class);\n    }\n\n    protected abstract Command givenACommand(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener);\n\n    private void whenACommandIsExecuted() {\n        command.execute();\n    }\n\n    protected abstract void thenTheCorrectMenuActionIsInvoked(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener);\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see in the `commandIsExecuted()` test we use all the abstract method to define the test of generic command\nimplementation. Now in the test subclasses we will implement the abstract method to feed the test with the various\nimplementation of our concrete commands.  \nSo we create an `AccountCommandTest` class, subclass of `CommandContract`, to test our `AccountCommand` class:\n\n```java\npublic class AccountCommandTest extends CommandContract {\n\n    protected Command givenACommand(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener) {\n        return new AccountCommand(menuActionsListener);\n    }\n\n    protected void thenTheCorrectMenuActionIsInvoked(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener) {\n        Mockito.verify(menuActionsListener).onAccountSelected();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe create also a `SettingsCommandTest` class, subclass of `CommandContract`, to test our `AccountCommand` class:\n\n```java\npublic class SettingsCommandTest extends CommandContract {\n\n    protected Command givenACommand(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener) {\n        return new SettingsCommand(menuActionsListener);\n    }\n\n    protected void thenTheCorrectMenuActionIsInvoked(MenuActionsListener menuActionsListener) {\n        Mockito.verify(menuActionsListener).onSettingsSelected();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see we tested all our concrete `Command` implementations without replicating the unit tests logic.\nWonderful :open_mouth::heart_eyes:!!!  \n[Here](https://github.com/chicio/Contract-Tests \"Contract test java example\") you can find the complete example (a Maven\nproject developed using IntelliJ, JUnit4, Mockito).  \nIt's time for you to test contract test on your project :joy::laughing:!!!\n","slug":"/2017/07/25/a-first-approach-to-contract-test/","description":"In this post I will talk about contract test: what they are and how you can use them.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"b60a4957-bf83-5265-a271-0788abb69f15":{"title":"React Native + Typescript, love at first sight. Setup in an existing app","content":"\n*In this post I will show you how to setup React Native + Typescript in an existing app.*\n\n---\n\nIn the last few months at [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") I worked on the\nfollowing project: rebuild the native mobile apps of the main brands [lastminute.com](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"Lastminute travel trips booking\"), [Volagratis](https://www.volagratis.com/ \"Volagratis travel trips booking viaggi\")\nand [Rumbo](https://www.rumbo.es/ \"Rumbo\") with a new interface and new features. Let's compare the old, and the new \nhome of the lastminute.com app. The changes are quite impressive :sunglasses:.\n\n![A comparison between the old and the new lastminute.com app home](../images/posts/compare-homes-lastminute.jpg)\n\nFor this \"app relaunch\" project we decided to use React Native (I already talked about this framework in some previous\nposts that you can find in the [archive section](/blog/archive \"archive\")). We didn't rewrite the apps from scratch. We\ndecided to integrated React Native in the existing code base and:\n\n* use [Native Modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios/ \"Native Modules\") to reuse some native code we\n  already had in place for some features (for example the login).\n* write the new stuff completely in React Native whenever possible.\n\nWe also took another important decision when we started the project: we choose TypeScript instead of Javascript as main\nlanguage to write our React Native stuff. What is TypeScript? It is an open-source programming language developed and\nmaintained by Microsoft. They describe it on its official website with the following definition:\n\n> Typescript is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open source.\n\nWhat does it means? It means that TypeScript is basically *\"Javascript on steroid\"*: it provides optional, static type\nchecking at compile time. Since it is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. TypeScript\nis helpful if you are a developer that comes from other strongly typed language and with you have a strong knowledge of\nObject Oriented programming because it let you reuse a lot of the programming technique you already know.  \nReact Native officially supports Javascript. How can we setup React Native + Typescript? In this post we will see how to\nintegrate React Native and Typescript in an existing app and we will add a new screen done in React Native where we will\nshow the photo of the day that we will read from the [Nasa open API](https://api.nasa.gov/ \"Nasa open api\"). Below you\ncan find what we will achieve. The first screen is a standard native screen. The second one is a React Native screen.\n\n![The example react native app we are going to create](../images/posts/react-native-typescript-app-screens.jpg)\n\nLet's start to setup our project for React Native and TypesScript. First, React Native integration. For this task we can\njust follow\nthe [React Native documentation regarding the integration with existing app](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps/)\n. Then we can start to integrate TypeScript. We will use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/ \"yarn\") as dependencies\nmanager instead of npm (you can use it also to install the dependencies needed to setup React Native in an existing app)\n. Yarn is a fast, reliable and secure dependencies manager released by Facebook in October 2016. Our project directories\nstructure will be the one contained in the screenshots below. The existing native codebase is contained inside the `ios`\nand `android` folders.\n\n![The folder structure of the project](../images/posts/react-native-typescript-directories.jpg)\n\nSo let's start by installing TypeScript and the types for React Native. We can do it with the following commands from\nthe root of our project:\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev typescript\nyarn add --dev @types/react @types/react-native\n```\n\nAfter that we need to configure TypeScript in our project. We can start to do that by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nyarn tsc --init --pretty --jsx react\n```\n\nNow we have a new file in the root of our project: the `tsconfig.json` file. This file is the configuration file for\nthe `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler. We can customize it for our needs (React). In particular, we need to enable the\noption `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` to allow default imports from modules with no default export. We also customized\nthe `baseUrl` and `paths` options. By settings them in this way and by adding a `package.json` file inside the `app`\nfolder with `name: \"app\"`, we can place all our source code in the `app` folder and when we need to import a class we\nwill set the path starting from the `app` base folder (so basically we are defining the root of our source code in a\nnice way for our imports).  \nBelow you can find the complete `tsconfig.json` file configured for our needs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es2015\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"checkJs\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"react-native\",\n    \"removeComments\": true,\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n    \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"app\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"app/*\": [\n        \"./*\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true\n  },\n  \"typeRoots\": [\n    \"./node_modules/@types\"\n  ],\n  \"types\": [\n    \"react\",\n    \"react-native\",\n    \"jasmine\",\n    \"jest\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \"app/__tests__\",\n    \"rn-cli.config.js\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAfter that we need to install\nthe [React Native TypeScript Transformer](https://github.com/ds300/react-native-typescript-transformer \"React Native TypeScript Transformer\")\n. This transformer will allow the React Native cli to automatically transpile our TypeScript code into Javascript on\ndemand. This is the command to install the transformer:\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev react-native-typescript-transformer\n```\n\nAfter that we need to configure the React Native cli to actually use the transformer by adding the following\nconfiguration to the `rn-cli.config.js` file (create it in the project root directory). This file is the React Native\nconfiguration file.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  getTransformModulePath() {\n    return require.resolve('react-native-typescript-transformer');\n  },\n  getSourceExts() {\n    return ['ts', 'tsx'];\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThat's all for the main source code setup. Now we can start to set up also the testing infrastructure. We will\nuse [jest](https://jestjs.io/ \"jest\"), a testing framework from Facebook,\nand [typemoq](https://github.com/florinn/typemoq \"typemoq\"), a TypeScript specific mocking library. To use Jest with\nTypescript we will install [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest \"typescript jest preprocessor\"), a TypeScript\npreprocessor with source map support for Jest that lets us use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev ts-jest\nyarn add --dev typemoq\n```\n\nAs you remember from the directory structure I show you above, the `__tests__` folder is not in the usual React Native\nproject position. It is placed inside the app folder. To be able to put our test in this folder we need to add to it\na `jest.config.js` file and set some custom option for related to the module resolution. Below you can find the entire\nfile with all the details.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  'preset': 'react-native',\n  'moduleFileExtensions': [\n    'ts',\n    'tsx',\n    'js',\n  ],\n  'rootDir': '../..',\n  'transform': {\n    '^.+\\\\.(js)$': '<rootDir>/node_modules/babel-jest',\n    '\\\\.(ts|tsx)$': '<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js',\n  },\n  'testMatch': ['**/__tests__/**/*.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)?(x)', '**/?(*.)(spec|test).(ts|tsx|js|jsx)?(x)'],\n  'testPathIgnorePatterns': [\n    '\\\\.snap$',\n    '<rootDir>/node_modules/',\n    'jest.config.js',\n  ],\n  'moduleDirectories': [\n    'node_modules',\n    '../',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nWe are now ready to write our app. Basically the screen that shows the nasa photo is the `NasaPhotoViewerScreen`. This\ncomponent uses `NasaPhotoInformationComponent` and some React Native standard component to show the information that\ncomes from the API. The informations are fetched using the `NasaPhotoService`. The `NasaPhotoViewerScreen` and\nthe `NasaPhotoService` are glued together using\nthe [Model-View-Presenter](/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/ \"Model View Presenter iOS\")\narchitecture in the `NasaPhotoComponentPresenter`. As you can see from the code below, TypeScript has a syntax that is\nsimilar to other language like Java, C# (and many other :sunglasses:).\n\n```jsx\nexport class NasaPhotoService {\n  async retrieve(): Promise<any> {\n    return fetch('https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=1cygunHJsSwDug6zJjF3emev3QAP8yFLppohLuxb')\n      .then((response) => response.json())\n  }\n}\n\n//...\n\nexport class NasaPhotoComponentPresenter {\n  private nasaPhotoRepository: NasaPhotoRepository\n  private nasaPhotoView: NasaPhotoView\n\n  constructor(nasaPhotoView: NasaPhotoView, nasaPhotoRepository: NasaPhotoRepository) {\n    this.nasaPhotoRepository = nasaPhotoRepository\n    this.nasaPhotoView = nasaPhotoView\n  }\n\n  async onStart(): Promise<void> {\n    try {\n      const nasaPhoto = await this.nasaPhotoRepository.load();\n      this.nasaPhotoView.showValid(nasaPhoto);\n    } catch (_) {\n      this.nasaPhotoView.showAn(\"Network error\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n//...\n\nexport class NasaPhotoViewerScreen extends React.Component<Props, State> implements NasaPhotoView {\n  private readonly\n  presenter: NasaPhotoComponentPresenter\n\n  constructor(props: Props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = {\n      photo: NasaPhoto.empty()\n    }\n    this.presenter = new NasaPhotoComponentPresenter(\n      this,\n      new NasaPhotoRepository(new NasaPhotoService(), new NasaPhotoAdapter())\n    )\n  }\n\n  componentWillMount() {\n    this.presenter.onStart()\n  }\n\n  showAn(error: string): void {\n    alert(error)\n  }\n\n  showValid(photo: NasaPhoto): void {\n    this.setState({ photo })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <ScrollView style={styles.container}>\n        <Image\n          style={styles.image}\n          {% raw %}source={{uri: this.state.photo.url}}{% endraw %}\n        />\n        <NasaPhotoInformationComponent\n          title={this.state.photo.title}\n          date={this.state.photo.date}\n          description={this.state.photo.description}\n        />\n      </ScrollView>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\ninterface Props {\n  name: string\n}\n\ninterface State {\n  photo: NasaPhoto\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    width: \"100%\",\n    height: \"100%\"\n  },\n  image: {\n    width: \"100%\",\n    height: 220,\n    resizeMode: \"cover\",\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can check all the code of the sample described above\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Typescript-Existing-App \"React Native Typescript Existing App\")\nand see all the TypeScript components I created for the app I shown you above.

As a reward for the hard work the team did, our customer area\nmanager [Elena Bianchini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenabianchini/), a manager with many years of experiences in big\ncompanies (e.g. Vodafone), decided to give us a two days retreat with a one day workshop in the location of Castelnuovo\nCalcea (Asti) at the bed &\nbreakfast [\"Cascina Il Quercin\"](https://www.tripadvisor.it/Hotel_Review-g1186672-d6420387-Reviews-Cascina_Il_Quercin-Castelnuovo_Calcea_Province_of_Asti_Piedmont/)\n. Below you can find some photos of this beautiful location (yes, I want you to be envy :grin:)\n\n![Cascina Il Quercin Castelnuovo Calcea](../images/posts/offsite-location.jpg)\n\nWhat was the main topic of the workshop? Well, in this one day workshop our UX team shown us what is the Design Thinking\nand the Design Sprint framework and we tried to apply it to came up with a solution for one of the next big projects we\nhave on the mobile app. Our UX team is composed by:\n\n* [Diletta Assandri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diletta-assandri-74b75745/ \"Diletta Assandri\") is a senior UX designer\n  with many years of experiences in project all over the world with Accenture Italia. She is truly passionate for her\n  work. She is one of the first designer I worked with that listen to what the developers have to say (\"NON SI PUÒ\n  FARE\" (that we could translate as \"this can't be done\") is one of her biggest nightmares :laughing:).\n* [Federica Pisuttu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicapisuttu/ \"Federica Pisuttu\") is the last new entry in the team\n  Lynch. She is a Senior UX designer with many years of experience in big companies like Assist Digital and she also\n  collaborate with various digital startup.\n\nLet's start from the definition of design thinking and design sprint:\n\n> Design thinking is a method for the practical, creative resolution of problems using the strategies designers use during the process of designing. Design thinking has also been developed as an approach to resolve issues outside of professional design practice, such as in business and social contexts. The design thinking process has various stages including: defining the problem, researching, forming ideas, prototyping and testing. The steps can occur simultaneously and be repeated.\n> A design sprint is a five-phase framework that helps answer critical business questions through rapid prototyping and user testing. Sprints let your team reach clearly defined goals and deliverables and gain key learnings, quickly. The process helps spark innovation, encourage user-centered thinking, align your team under a shared vision, and get you to product launch faster.\n\nSo design thinking is an approach to design product based on iterations of a series of step that includes: acquire a\ndeep knowledge of the problem, prototyping and user test your new product ideas. The design sprint is the formalization\nof design thinking: it is a time constrained process (usually 5 days) where all the design thinking steps are applied in\nsequence. During the workshop we tried to simulate a design sprint. We had just one day, so we compressed all the phases\nof a sprint in just a few hours :grin:.\n\n![Deciding the offsite agenda](../images/posts/offsite-agenda.jpg)\n\nWe created two separated teams and then we started our design sprint. Let's see the various phases we went through and\nthe final result.\n\n### Understand\n\nIn the first phase of our design sprint we tried to understand the problem we were approaching. To do this we used an\nexercise called \"A day in a life\". It helped us to think like our users. To apply it:\n\n* Start with the user’s first step or entrance into your product experience.\n* Add each step in the journey until the user’s goal has been reached.\n* Include descriptions for each step and highlight pain points along the journey.\n\nBy the end of this activity we had been able to highlight all the weakest/negative points of the section of the app we\nanalyzed.\n\n### Crazy 8\n\nThe second phase is the crazy 8. Let's see how our UX designers explained us this activity:\n\n> Fold your paper into 8 rectangles. Sketch 1 idea in each rectangle rather than a storyboard. Go for quantity, don’t worry about making these beautiful, these are just for yourself. Try to get beyond your initial idea.\n\nSo basically we tried to sketch out some ideas of how we could improve the section we analyzed in previous step by\ncreating some sketch. As the definition says, in this phase it is better to favor quantity over quality of the sketch.\nThe more ideas you get, the better it is. So everyone in the two teams started to draw at the speed of light like a 10\nyears old children :laughing:.\n\n![The crazy 8 phase](../images/posts/offsite-crazy-8.jpg)\n\n### One big idea\n\nThe next phase is called \"one big idea\". In this phase we had to choose some of the ideas we created during the crazy 8\nand try to go deeper in the details. It is basically a selection of ideas: you choose what you think are the best ideas\nyou created in the crazy 8 phase and you create a new prototype with a little bit more of details. As our UX designers\nexplained us we had to follow these key points:\n\n* Start outside of the software.\n* Focus on emotions.\n* Enough fidelity to start building a prototype.\n\n![The one big idea phase](../images/posts/offsite-one-big-idea.jpg)\n\n### Decide\n\nIn this phase we decided which one were the best ideas created in the previous phases. We decided by doing another\nexercise, the \"Share & Vote\". Basically we had 3 minutes to present our idea. After the presentations each team member\ngot “budget” of 3 dot stickers: we had to use them to vote what we thought was the best ideas. After voting the best 3\nideas were chosen as the base to create a detail prototype. So the final prototype is a mix of the best ideas created\nduring the sprint.\n\n![Decide: choose the best ideas](../images/posts/offsite-decide.jpg)\n\n### Prototyping\n\nIn this phase you need to create some prototype. Which kind of prototype? Let's see again how our UX designer explained\nus the features of good prototype:\n\n> Your Sprint is an attempt to identify the solution to a problem. Your prototype is a chance to see how good the ideas from your Decide phase are. To do this you have to make it real enough that you can get a realistic response from a potential user when you’re in the Validate phase.\n\nSo in this phase we had to go much deeper in the details of our ideas to get a working prototype that could be used as a\ntest with some real user. We used some of the famous tools available on the market,\nlike [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for example, and for some parts of our prototype we created a real demo.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThat was the end of our workshop (we didn't have enough real user for the validation test). It was very interesting to\nbe a UX designer just for one day. Honestly, a lot of time I found myself thinking: how can I do a job where I can use\nand improve my creativity? Software development requires a lot of creativity, but it is not the same kind of creativity\nthat is required to be a UX designer :relieved:. I don't think I will ever be a designer but it was a good starting\npoint to let me try to enter in the mindset of a UX designer (and also life is unpredictable so who knows? :blush:).\nAnyway...after the hard work...we had some relaxing moments :relieved:.\n\n![It's time for some relax](../images/posts/offsite-relax.jpg)\n\nTo be noted, in the right lower corner you can\nsee [Alessandro Romano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandroromano92/ \"Alessandro Romano\") during some swim stunts\nwith the lastminute.com mascot :laughing:. He is \"the clean\" a senior frontend developer with many years of experience\nthat just got graduated from University of Insubria in Varese (student/worker at the same time like I was some years\nago :blush:). So, what do you think about design thinking and design sprint? Let me know in the comments section below :\nblush:.\n","slug":"/2018/08/02/design-thinking-design-sprint-workshop/","description":"In this new post I will talk about my experience with design sprint and design thinking during a workshop I attended.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"b8975051-188c-5366-96a7-9169aeb20029":{"title":"Unit testing in Kotlin with JUnit 5 and MockK","content":"\n*I recently discovered MockK, a mocking library created for Kotlin. Let's see how it is possible to write modern unit\ntests with MockK + JUnit 5.*\n\n---\n\nAs I told you in my [last post](/2020/12/23/rest-template-webclient-spring-boot/), in the last months I wrote a lot\nof Kotlin backend code during my daily job. Usually I develop new stuff using Test Driven Development (TDD) technique.\nSpecifically, most of the time I use\nthe [mockist approach](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html#ClassicalAndMockistTesting). This\nbasically means that I need a mock library. For Java there are JMock and Mockito, and in fact I usually use Mockito. It\nis possible to use this library with Kotlin but [it has some limitations](https://antonioleiva.com/mockito-2-kotlin/).\nSo I started to wonder if there was an alternative, and I found that\nin [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") we were already using MockK, a mocking\nlibrary \"written in Kotlin for Kotlin\" :smirk:. In this post I will show you how to use MockK and JUnit 5 to improve you\nunit tests. To do this, I will migrate to Kotlin + MockK + JUnit 5 an old kata I did some time ago in Java + Mockito:\nthe Minesweeper. So let's start!!\n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start from the installation. For this kata I used [maven](https://maven.apache.org \"maven\") to manage my\ndependencies. To install JUnit 5 I used the JUnit\n5 [Bill of materials](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-maven-bom \"maven bom\"), usually abbreviated to BOM. If you don't\nknow what a BOM is, you can find the definition below (keep in mind that BOM is a general concept that you can find also\nin other build systems e.g. Gradle).\n\n> BOM is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a project’s dependencies and provide a central \n> place to define and update those versions. BOM provides the flexibility to add a dependency to our module without \n> worrying about the version that we should depend on.\n\nThe installation of MockK was easy. The only thing I needed to do is just to add the dependecy to the pom file. Below\nyou can find the entire pom file.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n         xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n\n    <properties>\n        <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>\n        <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>\n        <kotlin.version>1.4.21</kotlin.version>\n    </properties>\n\n    <groupId>it.chicio.minesweeper</groupId>\n    <artifactId>minesweeper</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0</version>\n    <dependencyManagement>\n        <dependencies>\n            <dependency>\n                <groupId>org.junit</groupId>\n                <artifactId>junit-bom</artifactId>\n                <version>5.7.0</version>\n                <type>pom</type>\n                <scope>import</scope>\n            </dependency>\n        </dependencies>\n    </dependencyManagement>\n\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\n            <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>\n            <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>io.mockk</groupId>\n            <artifactId>mockk</artifactId>\n            <version>1.10.4</version>\n            <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>\n            <artifactId>kotlin-stdlib-jdk8</artifactId>\n            <version>${kotlin.version}</version>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n\n    <build>\n        <plugins>\n            <plugin>\n                <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>\n                <artifactId>kotlin-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n                <version>${kotlin.version}</version>\n                <executions>\n                    <execution>\n                        <id>compile</id>\n                        <phase>compile</phase>\n                        <goals>\n                            <goal>compile</goal>\n                        </goals>\n                    </execution>\n                    <execution>\n                        <id>test-compile</id>\n                        <phase>test-compile</phase>\n                        <goals>\n                            <goal>test-compile</goal>\n                        </goals>\n                    </execution>\n                </executions>\n                <configuration>\n                    <jvmTarget>1.8</jvmTarget>\n                </configuration>\n            </plugin>\n            <plugin>\n                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n                <executions>\n                    <execution>\n                        <id>compile</id>\n                        <phase>compile</phase>\n                        <goals>\n                            <goal>compile</goal>\n                        </goals>\n                    </execution>\n                    <execution>\n                        <id>testCompile</id>\n                        <phase>test-compile</phase>\n                        <goals>\n                            <goal>testCompile</goal>\n                        </goals>\n                    </execution>\n                </executions>\n            </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n    </build>\n\n</project>\n```\n\nThe migration to Kotlin of the project was easy with IntelliJ IDEA: I just launched the automatic conversion tool that\nyou can find in the menu `Code -> Convert Java File to Kotlin File` and than fix some problem on the code obtained. In\nparticular, given the fact that there\nweren't [nullability annotations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html \"java nullability annotations\")\n, all the fields of all the classes were created as optional.  \nAfter the conversion I started to rewrite all the tests. Let's start to see how I rewrote the `FieldTest`, a test\nwithout mocks where I just needed to migrate from JUnit 5. In this test suite you can find some tests for\nthe `neighboursOf` method of the `Field` class. This method returns a list containing the cell statuses for the\nneighbours of a cell received as parameter (identified by its row and column position). The Java version of this test\nwas just a list of methods with the `@Test` annotation. Anyway,\nin [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) there are some annotations that can help you to improve\ntest naming and to organize them:\n\n* `@DisplayName(\"< New Name>\")`, an annotation used to declare a custom display name for the annotated test class or\n  test method. These names are typically used for test reporting in IDEs and build tools and may contain spaces, special\n  characters, and even emoji.\n* `@Nested`, an annotation used to signal that a class is a nested, non-static test class (i.e., an inner class) that\n  can share setup and state with an instance of its enclosing class.\n\nIn addition to these annotations, I used some Kotlin features:\n\n* backticks to define test method (again, you can use this feature only for tests, not in your production code).\n* body expression, a feature that let you avoid writing curly brackets if you method body contains just one line of\n  code.\n\nLast but not least, I also switched from the `assertThat` method and its matchers to `assertEquals` method, that is more\ndeveloper friendly in terms of error messages when your tests fail. Below you can find the final result.\n\n```kotlin\npackage it.chicio.minesweeper\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\n\n@DisplayName(\"Field\")\nclass FieldTest {\n    @Nested\n    @DisplayName(\"neighbours for\")\n    inner class NeighboursTest {\n        @Test\n        fun `1x1 field`() =\n                assertEquals(FieldFactory().make(arrayOf(arrayOf(\"*\"))).neighboursOf(0, 0), emptyList<String>())\n\n        @Test\n        fun `1x2 on left`() =\n                assertEquals(FieldFactory().make(arrayOf(arrayOf(\"*\", \".\"))).neighboursOf(0, 1), listOf(\"*\"))\n\n        @Test\n        fun `2x1 on right`() =\n                assertEquals(FieldFactory().make(arrayOf(arrayOf(\".\", \"*\"))).neighboursOf(0, 0),listOf(\"*\"))\n\n        @Test\n        fun `2x2 on right`() =\n                assertEquals(\n                        FieldFactory()\n                                .make(arrayOf(arrayOf(\".\", \"*\"), arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\")))\n                                .neighboursOf(0, 0),\n                        listOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\")\n                )\n\n        @Test\n        fun `2x3 on right and left`() =\n                assertEquals(\n                        FieldFactory()\n                                .make(arrayOf(arrayOf(\"*\", \".\", \"*\"), arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\")))\n                                .neighboursOf(0, 1),\n                        listOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\")\n                )\n\n        @Test\n        fun `3x3 with 3 bombs`() = assertEquals(\n                FieldFactory()\n                        .make(arrayOf(arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\"), arrayOf(\"*\", \".\", \"*\"), arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\")))\n                        .neighboursOf(1, 1), listOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\")\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCool, isn't it :sunglasses:? If I run this test in IntelliJ IDEA I can see the feedback about my test results (It seems\nalmost a list of [BDD behavioural tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)). If you ever tried\nto develop something with Jest on the frontend side of the web development world, you will feel at home.\n\n![An example of how your IDE will display tests feedback after renaming them with the @DisplayName and @Nested annotations](../images/posts/junit5-mockk-intellij-test-list.jpg)\n\nLet's move to a new test to see MockK in action. `FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThemTest` seems a good example where I\ncan show the basic building blocks MockK.  \nThe first thing I did was to create the mocks needed by the class under test. In contrast to the `Runner`, `TestRule`,\nand `MethodRule` hooks in JUnit 4, the JUnit 5 extension model consists of a single concept: the `Extension` API.\nExtensions are related to an event in the execution of a test, and they are called extension point. JUnit 5 engine will\ntrigger the registered extensions for each specific extension point. There are a lot of extension points available. You\ncan find the complete list in\nthe [Junit 5 doc](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions \"junit 5 extensions\"). As you can image\nMockK lets you initialize your mock with an Extension called `MockKExtension` (if you find more details, this is\na [TestInstancePostProcessor](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-test-instance-post-processing \"TestInstancePostProcessor\")\nand [ParameterResolver](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-parameter-resolution) extension).\nSo the first thing I needed to do was to add the `@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)` annotation on\nthe `FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThemTest` class. Then I can declared my mock with the annotation `@MockK`. Then I\nchanged also the setup method annotation with the new `@BeforeEach` annotation: in this way my class under test will be\ninitialized before each test.  \nAt this point I had everything setup in order to write the unit test with MockK. There are two main MockK construct:\n\n* the `every` behavioural construct, a function where you define what a mock should return for a specific method\n  invocation. There are various operator available to customize the argument matching and the return types.\n* the `verify` verification construct and all its declination, where you verify/check which invocation should happen on\n  your mocks.\n\nIn my case I rewrote the two unit test of the class using the constructs above. In the first one I used the\nbasic `verify` construct to verify the behaviour of my mocks. In the second one I used the `verifySequence` construct\ndeclination, a construct that checks the order and that all the matched calls are the only calls happened to declared\nmocks in the verify scope.  \nLast but not least, I used again the `@Nested` and `@DisplayName` annotation to declare better names for my tests. I\nalso moved some test static data to the companion object of the test suite class. Below you can find the final code.\n\n```kotlin\npackage it.chicio.minesweeper.field.resolver\n\nimport io.mockk.*\nimport io.mockk.impl.annotations.MockK\nimport io.mockk.junit5.MockKExtension\nimport it.chicio.minesweeper.FieldFactory\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith\n\n@DisplayName(\"FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem\")\n@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)\nclass FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThemTest {\n    @MockK\n    private lateinit var fieldResolver: FieldResolver\n\n    private lateinit var fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem: FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem\n\n    @BeforeEach\n    internal fun setUp() {\n        fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem = FieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem(fieldResolver)\n    }\n\n    @Nested\n    @DisplayName(\"resolve\")\n    inner class Resolve {\n        @Test\n        fun `single field list`() {\n            every { fieldResolver.resolve(field) } just Runs\n\n            val fields = fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem.resolve(listOf(field))\n\n            assertEquals(fields, listOf(resolvedField))\n            verify { fieldResolver.resolve(field) }\n        }\n\n        @Test\n        fun `fields list`() {\n            every { fieldResolver.resolve(field) } returns resolvedField\n            every { fieldResolver.resolve(anotherField) } returns anotherResolvedField\n\n            val fields = fieldsResolverByIteratingThroughThem.resolve(listOf(field, anotherField))\n\n            assertEquals(fields, listOf(resolvedField, anotherResolvedField))\n            verifySequence {\n                fieldResolver.resolve(field)\n                fieldResolver.resolve(anotherField)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    companion object {\n        private val field = FieldFactory().make(\n                arrayOf(\n                        arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\", \".\", \".\", \".\"),\n                        arrayOf(\".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\"),\n                        arrayOf(\".\", \"*\", \".\", \".\", \".\")\n                )\n        )\n        private val resolvedField = FieldFactory().make(\n                arrayOf(\n                        arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\"),\n                        arrayOf(\"3\", \"3\", \"2\", \"0\", \"0\"),\n                        arrayOf(\"1\", \"*\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\")\n                )\n        )\n        private val anotherField = FieldFactory().make(\n                arrayOf(\n                        arrayOf(\"*\", \".\", \".\", \".\"),\n                        arrayOf(\".\", \".\", \".\", \".\"),\n                        arrayOf(\".\", \"*\", \".\", \".\"),\n                        arrayOf(\".\", \".\", \".\", \".\")\n                )\n        )\n        private val anotherResolvedField = FieldFactory().make(\n                arrayOf(\n                        arrayOf(\"*\", \"*\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\"),\n                        arrayOf(\"3\", \"3\", \"2\", \"0\", \"0\"),\n                        arrayOf(\"1\", \"*\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\")\n                )\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's move to another test: `FieldValidRowParserTest`. In this test I had a different problem to solve for the setup of\nmy mocks: I wanted to set my mocks return values based on the value of their parameters. So what I'm talking about is\nargument matchers. MockK has a lot of argument matchers. You can find the complete\nlist [at this link](https://mockk.io/#matchers \"mockk matchers\"). One interesting note: contrary to what happens in\nother frameworks (e.g. Mockito), it is not required to specify an argument matcher for each argument. Some arguments can\nhave a fixed value (they will be automatically wrapped in a `eq` matcher). In my case, the only thing I wanted to do for\nmy `FieldValidRowParserTest` was to setup the mocks so that they returned the same value for any possible parameter\nvalue. This is why I decided to use the `any()` matcher.  \nThe second interesting thigng is related to the `verify` construct. In this test I needed to verify that the interaction\nwith the mock occured exactly 1 time. In MockK it is possible to customize the `verify` behaviour with some optional\nparameter. You can find the complete\nlist [at this link](https://mockk.io/#verification-atleast-atmost-or-exactly-times \"mockk verify configuration\"). In my\ncase I specified the value `1` for the `exactly` parameter.  \nBelow you can find final code for this second unit test.\n\n```kotlin\npackage it.chicio.minesweeper.field.parser\n\nimport io.mockk.every\nimport io.mockk.impl.annotations.MockK\nimport io.mockk.junit5.MockKExtension\nimport io.mockk.verify\nimport it.chicio.minesweeper.FieldFactory\nimport it.chicio.minesweeper.FieldsParsingStatusBuilder\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith\n\n@DisplayName(\"FieldValidRowParser\")\n@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)\nclass FieldValidRowParserTest {\n    @MockK\n    private lateinit var fieldRowContentParser: FieldRowContentParser\n\n    private lateinit var fieldValidRowParser: FieldValidRowParser\n\n    @BeforeEach\n    fun setUp() {\n        fieldValidRowParser = FieldValidRowParser(fieldRowContentParser)\n    }\n\n    @Nested\n    @DisplayName(\"parse\")\n    inner class Parse {\n        @Test\n        fun `a valid row`() {\n            every { fieldRowContentParser.tryToParseRowAndUpdate(any()) } returns fieldsParsingStatus\n\n            val newFieldsParsingStatus = fieldValidRowParser.parse(\". *\", FieldsParsingStatusBuilder().build())\n\n            assertEquals(newFieldsParsingStatus.currentRowContent, \". *\")\n            assertEquals(newFieldsParsingStatus.currentField, FieldFactory().make(\n                    arrayOf(\n                            arrayOf(\"*\", \".\"),\n                            arrayOf(\".\", \"*\")\n                    )\n            ))\n            verify(exactly = 1) { fieldRowContentParser.tryToParseRowAndUpdate(any()) }\n        }\n\n        @Test\n        fun `an invalid row`() =\n                assertEquals(\n                        fieldValidRowParser.parse(\"\", FieldsParsingStatusBuilder(currentRowContent = \"* *\").build()).currentRowContent,\n                        \"* *\"\n                )\n    }\n\n    companion object {\n        private val fieldsParsingStatus = FieldsParsingStatusBuilder(\n                currentRowContent = \". *\",\n                currentField = FieldFactory().make(\n                        arrayOf(\n                                arrayOf(\"*\", \".\"),\n                                arrayOf(\".\", \"*\")\n                        )\n                )\n        ).build()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find the entire source code of the Kata migrated to Kotlin + Junit 5 + MockK\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Katas/tree/master/minesweeper/kotlin-mockk-minesweeper \"kotlin mockk junit5 minesweeper\")\n.

Can it be\nimplemented using only TypeScript types?*\n\n---\n\nThis is the first of the four challenges I liked the most from \"Advent Of TypeScript 2023\" by [TypeHero](https://typehero.dev). \nCheck out the other challenges I liked [here](/2023/12/29/advent-of-typescript-2023-favourite-challenges/ \"advent of typescript 2023 challenges\").\n\n#### The problem\n\n\"Rock, paper scissors\" is a classical game used at coding dojo. Let's check the rule explained in a \"Christmas way\" \nby the guy from TypeHero:\n\n>It's Sunday and there's one week to go before the big day (Christmas Eve) when the elfs' work for the year will finally be complete. For the last 20 years the only game the elves have had to play together is StarCraft. They're looking for a fresh game to play.\n>So, they get the idea to try a Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament.  \n>   \n> But the elves are sorta nerdy so they want to accomplish this using TypeScript types. The `WhoWins` should type to \n> correctly determine the winner in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The first argument is the opponent and the second \n> argument is you!    \n>    \n> What's Rock, Paper, Scissors?\n> In case you haven't played it before, basically:\n> it's a two-player game where each player picks one of three options: Rock (👊🏻), Paper (🖐🏾), and Scissors (✌🏽)\n> game rules:\n>* Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)\n>* Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)\n>* Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)\n>* otherwise, a draw\n\nSo our goal is to implement the `WhoWins` type which will take two arguments:\n* the move of the opponent player\n* our move\nGiven these parameters, the type should be return if we win, lose or there is a draw. Let's go!!!\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe exercise gave me only a couple of code hints to start from: the union type `RockPaperScissors` and the `WhoWins` \nwithout any parameter.\n\n```typescript\ntype RockPaperScissors = '👊🏻' | '🖐🏾' | '✌🏽';\n\ntype WhoWins = unknown\n```\n\nLet's take a look also at the test cases provided by TypeHero to check if the implementation is correct.\n\n```typescript\ntype test_0_actual = WhoWins<'👊🏻', '🖐🏾'>; //'win'\ntype test_1_actual = WhoWins<'👊🏻', '✌🏽'>; //'lose'\ntype test_2_actual = WhoWins<'👊🏻', '👊🏻'>; //'draw'\ntype test_3_actual = WhoWins<'🖐🏾', '👊🏻'>; //'lose'\ntype test_4_actual = WhoWins<'🖐🏾', '✌🏽'>; //'win'\ntype test_5_actual = WhoWins<'🖐🏾', '🖐🏾'>; //'draw'\ntype test_6_actual = WhoWins<'✌🏽', '👊🏻'>; //'win'\ntype test_7_actual = WhoWins<'✌🏽', '✌🏽'>; //'draw'\ntype test_8_actual = WhoWins<'✌🏽', '🖐🏾'>; //'lose'\n```\n\nFrom the test cases, it was clear that I needed to define a type for the states of the game. I chose to type them \nas an enum called `GameState`. \n\n```typescript\nenum GameState {\n\tDraw = 'draw',\n\tWin = 'win',\n\tLose = 'lose'\n}\n```\n\nAfter the game state definition, I had to find a way to encode the game rule system using only TypeScript types. From \nthe description of the problem above, it is quite clear that the rules to make a player win are basically 3:\n\n* Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)\n* Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)\n* Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)\n\nIn all the other cases, there is a draw, and it doesn't really matter which is the move of each player.\n\nGiven the consideration above, I started to think about creating a type that takes as parameters the current move of \neach player and the expected move for a specific rule (of the 3 above).\nThis type should check internally if the current move of the opponent and of myself matches the one of a specific rule.\nIf they match, it means that I won, otherwise I lost.\nTo check if two moves match, I used [conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html \"conditional types\").\nLet's see what I implemented.\n\n```typescript\ntype Move<\n  CurrentMovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors, \n  ExpectedMovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors, \n  CurrentMovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors, \n  ExpectedMovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors\n> =\n  CurrentMovePlayerA extends ExpectedMovePlayerA\n    ? CurrentMovePlayerB extends ExpectedMovePlayerB\n      ? GameState.Win\n      : GameState.Lose\n    : never\n```\n\nThe first two rows of this `Move` type uses, as I mentioned before, conditional types to see if the current moves \nmatch the expected moves for a rule, and returns the correct game states.\nIf the move for one of the two players doesn't match the one of the rule I return `never`, a special type that \nrepresents the **type of values that never occur**.\nThis type has [two interesting features](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#the-never-type):\n\n* it is a subtype of and assignable to every type.\n* no type is a subtype of or assignable to never (except never itself).\n\nIn fact (in type theory terms) this is the [bottom type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type) of the \nTypeScript language.\nAfter creating the `Move` type I was able to encode the three rules we saw above, in a simple and self explained (by \nthe code itself) way. \n\n```typescript\ntype RockCrushesScissors<\n  MovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors,\n  MovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors\n> = Move<MovePlayerA, '✌🏽', MovePlayerB, '👊🏻'>\n\ntype PaperCoversRock<\n  MovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors,\n  MovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors\n> = Move<MovePlayerA, '👊🏻', MovePlayerB, '🖐🏾'>\n\ntype ScissorsCutPaper<\n  MovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors,\n  MovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors\n> = Move<MovePlayerA, '🖐🏾', MovePlayerB, '✌🏽'>\n```\n\nSo, the next question was: how ddo I combine them? The general consideration around the game is that you cannot have \nmultiple rules satisfied during a game run.\nThis can be coded in the TypeScript type system using a [union type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types) and relying on the `never` type, that has another interesting \nfeature when it comes to union types.\nIt is well explained here in the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#the-never-type):\n\n>Because never is a subtype of every type, it is always omitted from union types and it is ignored in function return type inference as long as there are other types being returned.\n\nThis basically means that, given **how I coded the non-matched case for the `Move` type**, and **given how `never` \nworks with union types**, I was able to create a union type that describe the whole rule system for which the player \ncould win. This led me to the creation of the `SomeoneWon` type.\nThe result of this type will always be the application of one and only one of the three rules, because for the \n`never` property we just saw, the rules that doesn't match will be discarded and omitted from the `SomeoneWon` type.\n\n```typescript\ntype SomeoneWon<MovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors, MovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors> = \n\t\t\t\t| PaperCoversRock<MovePlayerA, MovePlayerB> \n\t\t\t\t| ScissorsCutPaper<MovePlayerA, MovePlayerB> \n\t\t\t\t| RockCrushesScissors<MovePlayerA, MovePlayerB>\n```\n\nNow the only missing rule is the one that describes the draw state.\nFor it, I didn't need to know which are the specific current moves of each player, I just needed to check that the \nmoves were equal.\n\n```typescript\ntype Draw<\n  MovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors,\n  MovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors\n> = MovePlayerA extends MovePlayerB\n  ? GameState.Draw\n  : false\n```\n\nSo I was ready to define the `WhoWins` enum, as a combination of the types above plus one last missing type, \n`GameStateToString`, needed to convert the enum to a string (I will be honest, I regret my choice of an enum to \ndescribe the game state :sweat_smile:).\n\n```typescript\ntype GameStateToString<State extends GameState> = `${State}`\n\ntype WhoWins<MovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors, MovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors> =\n  Draw<MovePlayerA, MovePlayerB> extends GameState.Draw\n    ? GameStateToString<GameState.Draw>\n    : GameStateToString<SomeoneWon<MovePlayerA, MovePlayerB>>;\n```\n\nYou can find the full solution and the test cases we saw before to verify its correctness down below.\n\n```typescript\ntype RockPaperScissors = '👊🏻' | '🖐🏾' | '✌🏽';\n\nenum GameState {\n  Draw = 'draw',\n  Win = 'win',\n  Lose = 'lose'\n}\n\ntype GameStateToString<State extends GameState> = `${State}`\n\ntype Move<\n  CurrentMovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors,\n  ExpectedMovePlayerA extends RockPaperScissors,\n  CurrentMovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors,\n  ExpectedMovePlayerB extends RockPaperScissors\n> =\n  CurrentMovePlayerA extends ExpectedMovePlayerA\n    ?

Can it be  implemented using only TypeScript types?","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"be3f7f1c-9ea2-56d2-a281-b77409658422":{"title":"Swift Closure: demystifying @escaping and @autoclosure attributes","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about Swift closure and the potential of the @escaping and @autoclosure attributes.*\n\n---\n\nAs reported in the official swift documentation and as we saw in in one of\nmy [previous post](/2017/06/02/swift-closure-syntax/ \"previous post closures\"), closures are:\n\n> self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. They can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.\n\nIn this post I will show you two interesting closure features: `@autoclosure` and `@escaping`.  \nAn `@escaping` closure is passed as a parameter to a function, but it is not executed inside it. So, basically the\nclosure is executed after the function returns. The classical example is a closure being stored in a variable outside\nthat function.  \nAn `@autoclosure` attribute can be applied to a closure parameter for a function, and automatically creates a closure\nfrom an expression you pass in. This two attributes combined have great potential. Let's see an example where you can\navoid multiple if/switch with the use of closure and these two attributes.  \nYou could start \"abusing\" closures and use them everywhere after mastering these two attributes!! :\nstuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: (Maybe it's better to stay calm and don't abuse closures even after seeing this\nattributes :relieved:).\n\n![Swift closure are everywhere...](../images/posts/closure-everywhere.jpg)\n\nFor example we can have a `UITableView` and we want to execute different action for each cell displayed. If we don't use\nclosure and the attributes `@autoclosure` and `@escaping`, we need to distinguish the cells using the position or\neventually casting some specialization of a class used to represent the cell data. Suppose instead that each cell shows\nan instance of an `Operation` class, defined in this way:\n\n```swift\nclass Operation {\n    let name: String\n    let action: () -> ()\n\n    init(name: String, action: @autoclosure @escaping () -> ()) {\n        self.name = name\n        self.action = action\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo, basically in the constructor we are expecting something that will be enclosed in a closure, thanks to\nthe `@autoclosure` attribute, and we store it as an instance variable of our class. We can store it because we are using\nalso the `@escaping` attribute. Now in our controller we can define an array of operation that will be the datasource to\nour `UITableViewController`. We can pass in the constructor of each `Operation` instance the function that corresponds\nto the operation that we want to execute. This function will be executed in the table view delegate\nmethod `public func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)` by accessing the\ncorresponding element in the data source array, without the need to identify the exact cell type selected. Here you can\nfind the complete `OperationsViewController`:\n\n```swift\nclass OperationsViewController: UITableViewController {\n    var operations: [Operation] = []\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        self.operations.append(Operation(name: \"Operation 1\", action: self.showOrangeDetail()))\n        self.operations.append(Operation(name: \"Operation 2\", action: self.showGreenDetail()))\n    }\n\n    //MARK: TableView Datasource\n\n    public override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {\n        return self.operations.count\n    }\n\n    public override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {\n        let cell: UITableViewCell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: \"OperationCell\")!\n        cell.textLabel?.text = self.operations[indexPath.row].name\n        return cell\n    }\n\n    //MARK: TableView Delegate\n\n    public override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\n        self.operations[indexPath.row].action()\n    }\n\n    //MARK: Actions\n\n    private func showOrangeDetail() {\n        self.performSegue(withIdentifier: \"OrangeSegue\", sender: nil)\n    }\n\n    private func showGreenDetail() {\n        self.performSegue(withIdentifier: \"GreenSegue\", sender: nil)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can download the complete example [here](https://github.com/chicio/Autoclosure-and-Escaping \"autoclosure example link\").  \nSo basically: no if, no switch, only love :heart: for `@autoclosure` and `@escaping` :heart_eyes:.\n","slug":"/2017/06/14/swift-closure-demystifying-autoclosure-escaping/","description":"In this post I will talk about Swift closure and the potential of the @escaping and @autoclosure attributes","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"be7ecdef-d91a-565c-8c99-0d60c47d1cff":{"title":"Eat Your Own Dog Food: distribute a beta version of your iOS app using Apple Enterprise Developer Program","content":"\n*In this post I will show you how to distribute a beta version of your iOS app using Apple Enterprise Developer\nProgram.*\n\n---\n\nIn a [previous post](/2018/07/04/react-native-typescript-existing-app/ \"react native typescript\") I talked about\nthe \"app relaunch\" project I was involved in the last few months\nat [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\"). During one of the last sprint before\nthe release we started to think about putting in place an internal beta testing program to have more testing data and\neventually discover more bugs before the release on the App Store (we really wanted to eat our food :smile:). We thought\nabout using the TestFlight environment with external testers. But this solution didn't work for us because:\n\n* we wanted to let everyone in the company be able to install the beta version without the need for any kind of\n  registration. The external testers in the TestFlight environment must be registered in the \"External Tester\" section\n  of you app in the App Store Connect (someone said iTunes Connect?!?!?! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:).\n* we wanted to associate the beta with a new bundle id so that we could have a custom monitoring section in\n  the [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/ \"Fabric\") dashboard.\n* we didn't want to go through the \"light review\" that Apple does each time you want to distribute a new build to your\n  external tester. We also wanted to avoid the slow processing timing of TestFlight.\n\nSo what do we did? We put in place our custom Beta distribution program\nusing [Apple Enterprise Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/). By enrolling in this\nprogram you have the ability to distribute you app inside your company without the need of the App Store. You can\nbasically create your own Company App Store!! :open_mouth:\nI worked on the creation of this custom internal Beta distribution program with my\ncolleague [Giordano Tamburrelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giordano-tamburrelli-b532334/ \"Giordano Tamburrelli\").\nGiordano is the Team Leader of the Lynch Team, the agile team where I work at lastminute.com group. He has a Phd in\nComputer Science at Politecnico di Milano university and a master degree in Computer Science at the University of\nIllinois. He is one of the most skilled person I ever met, both from a technical and managerial point of view (yes you\nknow, I'm just kissing his ass :kissing_heart::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). Obviously, he is also one of the biggest\nnerd you could ever met :cupid::sparkling_heart:. So how did we decide to proceed? We basically did the following\noperation to put in place our beta program:\n\n* Create a new bundle identifier and a new provisioning profile in our enterprise account.\n* Create inside our app a new configuration with some customization for the Beta build.\n* Add some new scripts to automatize the creation and the upload of new beta ipa\n  using [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/ \"App Release Automation Fastlane\"), Jenkins (CI), maven (for the upload) and\n  Nexus as our repository manger (we already use all these platforms for the distribution of our release version and to\n  store development snapshots of the ipa).\n* Put in place a mini website, configured specifically for the distribution of the beta app.\n\nTo show you the details and some screenshots of the operation we made I will use a sample project `SampleBetaApp` with\nbundle identifier `it.chicio.SampleBetaApp`.  \nLet's start from the first step: configuration on the Apple developer account for our new enterprise program. As already\nexplained before, we decided to create a new bundle identifier for the beta app and obviously a new provisioning\nprofile. The procedure is basically the same of the standard program for both the bundle identifier and the provisioning\nprofile. We just need to follow the instruction in the Apple Developer Account site in the section \"Certificates,\nIdentities & Profiles\" (and maybe there's a high chance that, if you're reading this post you already release at least\none app on the Apple app store so you already know the stuff to do :smirk:).\n\n![Certificates, Identities & Profiles section on the developer Apple website](../images/posts/enterprise-profiles.jpg)\n\nAfter that we created in our iOS project a new Beta configuration by duplicating the release one. In this way we were\nable to generate an ipa similar to the release one and were also able to customize some settings of our app.\n\n![Add a new beta build configuration](../images/posts/beta-configuration.jpg)\n\nThe Build Setting that we customized are:\n\n* Obviously the bundle identifier. Here we used the one created in the first step (Apple Enterprise developer Account\n  configuration). The entry that we modified in the Build settings is named \"Product Bundle Identifier\".\n\n![Set a new product identifier for the beta build](../images/posts/beta-bundle-identifier.jpg)\n\n* The app icon. You can add a new asset in your main assets catalog. The entry that we modified in the Build settings is\n  named \"Asset Catalog App Icon Set Name\".\n\n![Set a new icon for the beta build](../images/posts/beta-icon.jpg)\n\n* We added a new custom preprocessor macro in the \"Preprocessor Macros\" build setting to be able to detect in our source\n  code that we are running a beta version and eventually do some custom stuff. For example we added the build version\n  number in the about section only for the beta version. In this way our tester were able to tell us exactly which\n  version they were using. This macro is visible only to Objective-C. If you need to do the same thing in Swift you need\n  to customize the \"Other Swift Flags\" field.\n\n![Set a new beta preprocessor macro](../images/posts/beta-preprocessor-macro.jpg)\n\nThen we created the scripts needed to automatize the build on Jenkins and the upload of our artifacts repository to\nNexus. As I said before we were already using Fastlane to automatize the releases of our app to the store. For the beta\npublishing process we decided to create a new lane in our Fastfile where we launch a custom script to do all the\noperation needed to publish our beta.\n\n```bash\nlane :create_beta_ipa do |options|\n  sh './scripts/build_beta.sh'\nend\n```\n\nAs you can see below, in the script `build_beta.sh` we do three things:\n\n* We generate an archive of our app using the `xcodebuild archive` command using the Beta configuration we created\n  before. We customized some other options. For example the archive path. At the end of this command we obtain a file\n  named `SampleBetaApp.xcarchive` in the folder `<project root>/DerivedData/Beta`.\n* Then we exported the ipa by using the `xcodebuild -exportArchive` command. This command needs and `exportOptionsPlist`\n  file that contains some exporting options, including the provisioning profile name that must corresponds to the name\n  of the provisioning profile we created at the beginning in the Apple Enterprise Developer account. Below the script\n  you can find the `exportOptions-SampleBetaApp.plist` sample file for the `SampleBetaApp` project.\n* Last but not least, when the ipa is ready we upload it on Nexus using Maven (in the script below you can find some\n  placeholder for some of the parameter used :wink:). The command is simple and clear: we are uploading our artifact,\n  the ipa, without generating any pom version. One important thing to note: we use always 1 as version, because we\n  decided that we don't want to store the beta versions history. We just want to keep the last one we publish.\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nTARGET=\"SampleBetaApp\"\nDERIVED_DATA_BETA_PATH=\"../DerivedData/Beta/\"\nBETA_TARGET_PATH=$DERIVED_DATA_BETA_PATH$TARGET\nXARCHIVE=\"${BETA_TARGET_PATH}/${TARGET}.xcarchive\"\nIPA=\"${BETA_TARGET_PATH}/${TARGET}.ipa\"\n\nxcodebuild -workspace ../Container.xcworkspace\n            -scheme \"$TARGET\"\n            -sdk iphoneos\n            -configuration Beta\n            archive -archivePath \"$XARCHIVE\"\n\nxcodebuild -exportArchive\n            -archivePath \"$XARCHIVE\"\n            -exportOptionsPlist \"exportOptions-${TARGET}.plist\"\n            -exportPath \"$BETA_TARGET_PATH\"\n\nmvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=\"<group id project identifier>\"\n                        -DartifactId=\"$TARGET\"\n                        -Dversion=1\n                        -DgeneratePom=false\n                        -DrepositoryId=nexus\n                        -Durl=\"<nexus repository url>\"\n                        -Dfile=\"$IPA\"\n```\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>method</key>\n        <string>enterprise</string>\n        <key>signingCertificate</key>\n        <string>iOS Distribution</string>\n        <key>provisioningProfiles</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>it.chicio.BETA.SampleBetaApp</key>\n            <string>SampleApp Beta Distribution</string>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\nAt this moment we were ready to create the new Jenkins job to build our beta. We decided to trigger it using Jenkins\nwebhook triggers. In this way we were able to trigger the build and release of a new beta by just calling an url. This\njob basically clone our app repository and then execute the lane `create_beta_ipa` that we defined before in the\nFastlane Fastfile.  \nSo in the end with all this steps above we obtained an ipa reachable at a public url (on Nexus). We decided to publish\nour beta using Github Pages (the same service that runs this website :hearts:). Why? Because we needed a server with\nHTTPS already configured. Github pages let us create the beta website really fast. So we created a new account and\npublished a new html that contains the following code:\n\n```html\n\n<html>\n<head>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n  <a href=\"itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=<a base url>manifest.plist\">\n<p>Install the SampleAppBeta app</p>\n</a>\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAs you can see above, in this html there's a special link with the protocol `itms-services`. If a user clicks on this\nlink from Safari browser on a iOS device, the download and the installation of the app will starts. If you look\ncarefully at the content of the link above, you will notice there's a reference to a url of a **manifest.plist** file.\nThis is a file generated by Xcode if you export an archive with an enteprise certificate and contains some metadata for\nthe ipa, including the location/url of the ipa to be downloaded. In our case this url was the Nexus link to the ipa.\nThis file can be generated the first time and eventually edited if there's any change. This is a sample manifest file\nthat could be used for our SampleBetaApp.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>items</key>\n        <array>\n            <dict>\n                <key>assets</key>\n                <array>\n                    <dict>\n                        <key>kind</key>\n                        <string>software-package</string>\n                        <key>url</key>\n                        <string>http://www.example-url-to-where-the-ipa-is.com/SampleBetaApp.ipa</string>\n                    </dict>\n                    <dict>\n                        <key>kind</key>\n                        <string>display-image</string>\n                        <key>url</key>\n                        <string>https://www.example.com/image.57x57.png</string>\n                    </dict>\n                    <dict>\n                        <key>kind</key>\n                        <string>full-size-image</string>\n                        <key>url</key>\n                        <string>https://www.example.com/image.512x512.png</string>\n                    </dict>\n                </array>\n                <key>metadata</key>\n                <dict>\n                    <key>bundle-identifier</key>\n                    <string>it.chicio.SampleBetaApp</string>\n                    <key>bundle-version</key>\n                    <string>1.0.0</string>\n                    <key>kind</key>\n                    <string>software</string>\n                    <key>title</key>\n                    <string>beta-sample.com</string>\n                </dict>\n            </dict>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n```  \n\nNow we were ready to distribute our beta app, and you know everything is needed to create your own beta program. One\nlast thing: you will need to explain to the less experienced user that they need to accept the enterprise provisioning\nprofile from *Settings -> Profiles & Device Management*. If they don't do it they will see the alert contained in the\nscreenshot below.\n\n![You need to accept the developer certificate before using the app](../images/posts/enterprise-untrusted-developer.jpg)\n\nThat's it!!! Go to your boss and tell her/him you're ready to create you custom iOS beta internal program!!! :\nsunglasses::apple:\n","slug":"/2018/07/05/distribution-enterprise-app-ios-beta/","description":"In this post I will show you how to distribute a beta version of your iOS app using Apple Enterprise Developer Program.","authors":["giordano-tamburrelli","fabrizio-duroni"]},"bf827441-d572-5079-979e-f2b4ce6a5b7c":{"title":"React Native: a simple architecture for Native Modules communication with your UIViewController on iOS","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about a simple architecture for communication between React Native Native modules (aka\nbridges) and your native code on iOS.*\n\n---\n\n[As we saw in a previous post for fragments/Activities Android](/2018/12/02/react-native-modules-bridge-communication-activitiy-fragment-android/), \nsometimes when you integrated React Native in an existing app, you will want to be able let your Native Modules\nbridges communicate with your `UIVIewController`, especially the ones that contain the React Native View. In this post I\nwill show you an architecture to put in place this communication on iOS, that will be compatible with all the features\nof React Native (for example it will work also with the live reload functionality). This is an architecture I put in\nplace for our apps at [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com\"). To show this\narchitecture I will create a simple app that show a React Native screen as a modal. I will then implement the close\nbutton functionality by calling a native module from the `onPress` on a React Native button. Below you can see the final\nresult.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJLX27nancs`\n\nThe architecture I put in place is based on the `NSNotificationCenter`. The description of this component of the iOS SDK\nis the following one:\n\n> A notification dispatch mechanism that enables the broadcast of information to registered observers. Objects register with a notification center to receive notifications (NSNotification objects) using the addObserver(_:selector:name:object:) or addObserver(forName:object:queue:using:) methods. When an object adds itself as an observer, it specifies which notifications it should receive. An object may therefore call this method several times in order to register itself as an observer for several different notifications.\n\nThis definition basically means that with this api we are able to register class to events send by another one. This is\nexactly what we need to put in place the communication between our Native Modules bridges and our `UIViewController`.\nLet's start from the `MainViewController`. In it there's only a button with an action to start the React Native modal\nUIViewController called `ReactNativeModalViewController`.\n\n ```swift\n class MainViewController: UIViewController {\n     override func viewDidLoad() {\n         super.viewDidLoad()\n     }\n\n     @IBAction func showReactNativeModal(_ sender: Any) {\n         present(ReactNativeModalViewController(), animated: true, completion: nil)\n     }\n }\n ```\n\nThe `ReactNativeModalViewController` is a `UIViewController` with the setup needed to launch a React Native context.\nThis `UIViewController` is an observer of the `ReactEventCloseModal` event in the `NSNotificationCenter`. This event is\ngenerated in the Native Modules bridge. The action executed for this event is contained in the `closeModal` event.\n\n```swift\nclass ReactNativeModalViewController: UIViewController {\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        setupReactNative()\n        registerToReactNativeEvents()\n    }\n\n    private func setupReactNative() {\n        let rootView = RCTRootView(\n            bundleURL: URL(string: \"http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios\"),\n            moduleName: \"ReactNativeModal\",\n            initialProperties: nil,\n            launchOptions: nil\n        )\n        self.view = rootView\n    }\n\n    private func registerToReactNativeEvents() {\n        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,\n                                               selector: #selector(closeModal),\n                                               name: NSNotification.Name(rawValue: ReactEventCloseModal),\n                                               object: nil)\n    }\n\n    @objc private func closeModal() {\n        DispatchQueue.main.async { [unowned self] in\n            self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow let's have a look at Native Module created for the app, the `ReactNativeModalBridge`. In this bridge there just one\nreact method, `closeModal`. This is the one called from the React Native JS side. In this method we are sending an event\nwith the identifier `ReactEventCloseModal`. This identifier is defined inside the\nfiles `ReactNativeEvents.h/ReactNativeEvents.m` as a constant with string value `closeModal`.\nThe `ReactNativeModalViewController` is subscribed to this type of event (as we saw above). This basically means that\nwhen the `closeModal` bridge method is called from the React Native Javascript code a new event `ReactEventCloseModal`\nis generated and the `ReactNativeModalViewController` will execute the subscribed method defined in it. We have all\nsetup to have our Native Modules communication with our controllers :open_mouth:. Below you can find the header and\nimplementations of the `ReactNativeModalBridge` bridge (written in Objective-C :sparkling_heart:).\n\n```objective_c\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>\n\n@interface ReactNativeModalBridge : NSObject<RCTBridgeModule>\n\n@end\n  \n  \n#import \"ReactNativeModalBridge.h\"\n#import \"ReactNativeEvents.h\"\n\n@implementation ReactNativeModalBridge\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE();\n\nRCT_EXPORT_METHOD(closeModal) {\n    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:ReactEventCloseModal object:nil];\n}\n\n@end\n```\n\nNow it's time to see the javascript code. Below you can see the `ReactNativeModal` component. Inside this component\nthere is a call to the native module `NativeModules.ReactNativeModalBridge.closeModal()` described above. In this way\nthe modal will be closed directly from the native side.\n\n```jsx\nclass ReactNativeModal extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.hello}>Hello modal!</Text>\n        <Text style={styles.message}>\n          I'm a react native component. Click on the button to close me using native function.\n        </Text>\n        <Button\n          title={\"Close me\"}\n          onPress={() => NativeModules.ReactNativeModalBridge.closeModal()}\n        />\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's all for our native modules communication architecture iOS. You can find the complete example\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Native-Modules-Communication). If you want to know\nhow we managed the same problem on the Android platform :rocket: you can\nread [my other post about the same topic](/2018/12/02/react-native-modules-bridge-communication-activitiy-fragment-android/).\n","slug":"/2018/12/03/react-native-modules-bridge-communication-uiviewcontroller-ios/","description":"In this post I will talk about a simple architecture for communication between React Native Native modules (aka bridges) and your native code on iOS.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"cbcbdc9e-9987-5b67-9083-5b92f1b41f67":{"title":"Github Pages and Jekyll: chicio coding birth","content":"\n*So, how I created this blog? Let's go through the development process of its creation. This is yet another blog post\nabout the creation of a website using Github Pages and Jekyll. But you know, I have to do it.*\n\n---\n\nThis will be the first official post of my blog. So, the topic from which I want to start is the development of this\nwebsite. This is a *blog post about this blog* (are you serious!? :laughing:). This blog has been built\nusing [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com \"Github Pages\"). What exactly are they? Let's see the definition taken\nfrom the github documentation:\n\n> GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository. To learn more about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, see \"User, organization, and project pages.\" You can create and publish GitHub Pages online using the Jekyll Theme Chooser. If you prefer to work locally, you can use GitHub Desktop or the command line. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.\n\nGithub Pages supports Jekyll. Also in this case let's see the definition from the documentation:\n\n> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites.\n\nThis seems the perfect combination for a personal site + blog!!!\nLet's see what I used to develop this blog:\n\n* Github Pages\n* Jekyll\n* Node + Gulp as a task/build runner for development\n* Bootstrap + Sass for CSS/HTML\n* Gsap and Scrollmagic for animation\n* Cloudflare as CDN\n\nI also used threejs for the background scene on my [homepage](/ \"homepage\"). I will talk about it in a different post.\nFirst of all I installed node. Then I created\nthe [Jekyll basic directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/\n\"Jekyll basic directory structure\"). Then I run the command:\n\n```shell\nnpm init\n```\n\nto create the package.json (the file that will contain the metadata of my project, including its dependencies).  \nThen I installed Gulp:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev gulp\n```\n\nI decided to use the following gulp libraries to improve my work (using the same command used for Gulp to install them):\n\n* gulp-concat and gulp-uglify to concatenate all my css and js in a style.min.css, index.min.js and vendor.min.js (the\n  last one for third party library)\n* gulp-sass to compile sass into CSS\n* gulp-uglify for minification\n* child_process to launch Jekyll along side Gulp, as explained by Aaron Lasseigne on\n  his [blog post](https://aaronlasseigne.com/2016/02/03/using-gulp-with-jekyll/ \"Aaron Lasseigne\")\n* critical to dynamically extract the CSS critical path from the various template, in order to be complaint with the\n  Google page speed recommendation.\n* browser-sync for live reloading during development\n* travis for CI\n\nYou can find the complete gulpfile in this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/chicio/ce1b5339fa2f30c0c14fceb3616d60d3).  \nAs you can see I have two gulp task. I use the first from my local environment during development. The second one is\nused by by travis to make a test build on each commit. All the assets created are saved in the assets folder. Jekyll\ncopies each folder that is not prefix with and underscore. I also installed some gems to improve and automatize some\nfunction of my site:\n\n* jekyll-seo-tag, to automatically create meta and JSON-LD\n* jekyll-sitemap, to automatically generate the sitemap\n* octopress-minify-html, to minify the HTML\n* jekyll-paginate, to support pagination\n* jemoji, to support emoji in posts\n\nEach of this gem has its own configuration values in the `_config.yml` or in the front matter using the YAML format.  \nWith this setup it was easy to develop. To start the development environment I just have to execute the shell command\nbelow.\n\n```shell\ngulp\n```\n\nThis command launch the default gulp task and start to write my HTML/CSS/Javascript code. The website is updated on each\nmodification and live rendered in the browser (thank you browser-sync :relaxed: ).  \nAfter the implementation, made also some infrastructure setup to customize my github pages website. In particular, I \nadded two things:\n\n* I bought a custom domain, fabrizioduroni.it, to substitute the default github pages url for user site (\"username\"\n  .github.io).\n* I added CloudFlare CDN in order to:\n    * speed up the content loading and reach the 99% score on the Google Pagespeed test\n    * add HTTPS and HTTP/2 support\n\nIn this way the pages load faster than light :zap:.  \nThat's it.

In this post we will start to learn how to use textures.  \nAs you may already know, textures are useful to add realism to a material. We can manage textures from the texture tab\ninside the properties panel. From that panel we can create a new texture by clicking on the + button. After creating a\nnew texture, some options are displayed that let us customize how the texture looks like. The type of texture we select\nchanges the options displayed: there will be a specific section of properties for the type we choose.\n\n![Create a texture](../images/posts/blender-create-texture.jpg)\n\nIn the various section of the texture panel we have the \"influence section\". This section is very important because it\nlet us customize how the texture will affect the final material. This means that we can use textures to change not only\nthe final color of the material but also the shading components, geometry, specular highlight and so on.\n\n![The influence section](../images/posts/blender-texture-influence.jpg)\n\nTo add the image to be used as texture we have to select the type \"Image or movie\". After that we can scroll in the\noption of the texture to the Image section and we can choose between create a new image or open an existing one.\n\n![Add an image to a texture](../images/posts/blender-texture-add-image.jpg)\n\nAfter that we need to define the mapping of the texture on the surface. We can find this section by scrolling down in\nthe texture tab. The most important option here is \"Coordinates\". This option let us define the mapping of texture\ncoordinates on the image. By default is set to generated, that means that the coordinates are generated by blender for\nthe defaults primitives. Then there's the UV option, that maps to coordinates baked into the object.\n\n![Choose texture mapping](../images/posts/blender-texture-choose-mapping.jpg)\n\nRemember that after an images has been selected as texture, it will not be shown in the 3D window if we choose the\ntexture visualization unless we load it in the UV editor. To do it choose UV editing layout and load the texture using\nthe open button.\n\n![The UV editor](../images/posts/blender-texture-uv-load-image-for-3d-view.jpg)\n\nThe UV editor is the main tool to work with texture. By using it we can precisely apply a texture to an object using the\nunwrap texture tools. To do this we need first to define seams. Seams (as in sewing) are where the ends of a mesh are\nsewn together. Blender uses seams to understand where to unwrap the mesh. We can defines seams by selecting the edges we\nwant to mark and use the menu Mesh -> Edges -> Mark Seams. We can recognized seams as they are reported as red lines in\nthe 3D window.\n\n![Blender texture mark seams](../images/posts/blender-texture-mark-seams.jpg)\n\nThe we can unwrap the mesh by just selecting Mesh -> UV unwrap -> Unwrap. After that we can scale, translate and rotate\nthe unwrapped mesh to fit into the texture. After that we will finally see the texture on our mesh.\n\n![Blender texture unwrap 1](../images/posts/blender-texture-unwrap-1.jpg)\n\n![Blender texture unwrap b](../images/posts/blender-texture-unwrap-2.jpg)\n\nWe can also create projection mapping using the UV projection. This basically means projecting a sphere, cylinder or a\ncube onto our project to get some rough mapping that we can tweak later. We can find UV projection under Mesh -> UV\nUnwrap -> <Sphere/Cylinder/Cube> projection.\n\n![Blender uv projection](../images/posts/blender-uv-projection.jpg)\n\nIn the next post we will talk about other textures technique available in Blender.\n","slug":"/2019/03/22/blender-tutorial-8-textures-part-1/","description":"In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about textures.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"d15f1d19-3a26-5df6-8598-a44c55947ffe":{"title":"How to calculate the reflection vector","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about reflection vector used in some lighting models, for example the Phong reflection model.\nI will show you how this vector is calculated.*\n\n---\n\nIn a [previous post](/2017/07/26/phong-lighting-model/ \"phong model post\") I talked about the Phong lighting model.\nI described all the different components contained inside it and how they try to describe and simulate different kind of\nlight components. In particular you will remember that there's a specular component that try to simulated the light\nreflected in a specific direction: the reflection direction. In the shader implementation this direction has been\ncalculated using a GLSL method `reflect`:\n\n```glsl\nvec3 reflectionDirection = reflect(-lightDirection, normalInterp);\n```\n\nEasy, isn't it? But the most curios of you may asking: \"How the f*$k this method calculate this reflection direction?\" :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  \nWe will suppose as in the previous post about the phong model that all vectors are normalized. Let's start from the\nbeginning. The formula to calculate the reflection direction is:\n\n$$\nR = 2({\\hat{N}}\\cdot{\\hat{L}}){\\hat{N}} - {\\hat{L}}\n$$\n\nHow is this formula obtained? Let's start from a picture that represents our reflection vector and the other vectors\nused in the calculation.\n\n![A representation of the reflection phenomenon with all the vectors involved](../images/posts/reflection.png)\n\nBefore we start with the demonstration we also need to know what is the law of reflection:\n\n> The incident light ray L, the reflected ray R, and the normal N to the surface of the mirror all lie in the same plane. The angle of reflection $\\Theta_R$ is equal to the angle of incidence of light $\\Theta_L$. Both angles are measured with respect to the normal to the mirror. The reflected ray and the incident ray are on the opposite sides of the normal.\n\nNow we are ready for our demonstration :sunglasses:.  \nFrom the law of reflection reported above we know that:\n\n$$\n\\Theta_R=\\Theta_L\n$$\n\nThis equation could be rewritten as the dot product of the reflection direction with the normal equals the dot product\nof the incident light direction and the normal (remember that\nthe [dot product of two vector is equal to the cosine of the angle between them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product \"dot product of two vector is equal to the cosine of the angle between them\"))\n. So we have:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {R}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}} = {\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}\n$$\n\nFrom the image above it's also evident for symmetry that:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {U}^{\\prime}} = -{\\hat {U}^{\\prime \\prime}}\n$$\n\nAs you can see again from the image above, this two vectors could be easily calculated. In fact the first one is the\ndifference between the reflection vector and\nthe [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection \"vector projection\") of it on the normal. The second\none is the difference between the light incident vector and the projection of it on the normal. So for the reflection\nside we could write:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {U}^{\\prime}} = {\\hat {R}} - {\\hat {N}^{\\prime}} = {\\hat {R}} - ({\\hat {R}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}}\n$$\n\nFor the light side we could write:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {U}^{\\prime \\prime}} = {\\hat {L}} - {\\hat {N}^{\\prime \\prime}} = {\\hat {L}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}}\n$$\n\nAs a consequence we obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {R}} - ({\\hat {R}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}} = -({\\hat {L}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}})\n$$\n\nNow we can see again from the image above that the vector projections ${\\hat {N}^{\\prime}}$ and ${\\hat {N}^{\\prime\n\\prime}}$ are equals, that means we could change the previous equation by substituting the first one with the second\none. So we obtain the following equation:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {R}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}} = -({\\hat {L}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}})\n$$\n\nNow we have all we need to calculate our R vector:\n\n$$\n{\\hat {R}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}} = -({\\hat {L}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}})\n$$\n\n$$\n{\\hat {R}} = ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}} - ({\\hat {L}} - ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}})\n$$\n\n$$\n{\\hat {R}} = ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}} - {\\hat {L}} + ({\\hat {L}} \\cdot {\\hat {N}}){\\hat {N}}\n$$\n\n$$\nR = 2({\\hat{N}}\\cdot{\\hat{L}}){\\hat{N}} - {\\hat{L}}\n$$\n\nThat's it!!

But what about tracking? In this tutorial I will show you how simple\nit is to implement offline tracking with Google Analytics in your PWA.*\n\n---\n\nAs you may already understood from my previous post, I felt\nin [love with PWA](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"progressive web app\"). For the ones \"late to the\nparty\" of PWA, let's see the definition of what they are:\n\n> Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:\n>\n>* Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.\n>* Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.\n>* Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.\n>* This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.\n\nBasically PWA brings native mobile alike experience to the web. One of the features that PWAs take from mobile apps is\noffline capabilities. In fact it is possible to develop a web application that works completely offline with the help\nof [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API \"service worker\"). But what\nabout tracking stuff when the web app is offline? The\nstandard [Google Analytics Web SDK](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs \"google analytics\")\ndoesn't support offline tracking out of the box. So is it possible to avoid to loose important tracking events when your\nuser is using the PWA offline? Yes it is. Let's find out how we can do it :relaxed:.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nMake Google Analytics works offline is as simple as importing a script and call a function! This is possible thanks\nto [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox). What is it? Let's the definition reported on its official\nwebsite:\n\n> Welcome, Workbox is a set of libraries and Node modules that make it easy to cache assets and take full advantage of features used to build Progressive Web Apps.\n\nBasically it is a JavaScript library that help developer to build full PWA. It has been developed by the some of the\nGoogle Chrome Core Member team. One if its main feature is the support\nfor [Google Analytics offline tracking](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/enable-offline-analytics \"google analytics offline\")\n. This is exactly what we need! :heart_eyes:. Let's see the implementation.  \nIn my service worker file I imported the workbox javascript script with\nthe `importScript` [directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts \"import script service worker\")\n. Then I setup workbox by initializing it (and I also turn the debug features). Then I just need to initialize the\nworkbox Google Analytics plugin and that's it. This is the final implementation.\n\n```javascript\nimportScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/4.3.1/workbox-sw.js');\n\n//...other service worker code....\n\nworkbox.setConfig({ debug: false })\nworkbox.googleAnalytics.initialize();\n\n//...other service worker code....\n\n```\n\n#### How it works\n\nHow does workbox make your GA tracking working when your PWA is offline? The `workbox.googleAnalytics` plugin setup a\nnew fetch handler that intercepts all the requests made with Google Analytics. These requests are basically network\ncalls done with\nthe [Google Analytics Measurement protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1 \"google analytics measurement protocol\")\n. When your PWA goes offline this handler stores the failed call into an\nad-hoc [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API \"indexeddb api\") schema\ncalled `workbox-background-sync`. When the network came back the the requests saved are flushed and pushed to the Google\nAnalytics servers as measurement protocol requests. Below you can find a video that shows you the entire flow described\nabove.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xshb2rM4L3w`\n\nOne important thing: for all my request you can see two entries in `workbox-background-sync` schema: one for the page\nthe user is visiting and one for `/blog`, the homepage of my blog. This is a consequence of the fact that for each page\non my website I use the `prefetch` tag to cache the homepage of the blog on every page on my website (because by\nwatching my tracking in google analytics, I saw that the majority of the visitors of my website goes to the homepage of\nthe blog as second page in the step of their navigation).\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nGoogle Analytics offline tracking is another feature that makes PWAs more similar to native mobile apps. As I already\nsaid in [other posts](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/ \"progressive web app\"), the gap between web and\nnative development is closing more and more each day. You can already start to think about giving almost the same user\nexperience to your user on all platforms (web and native). I will say a prayer for this end of the year: please Apple\ndon't stay behind your competitor and remember what you said in 2008 (when web technologies where not as advanced as of\ntoday) :heart:.\n","slug":"/2019/12/15/pwa-offiline-tracking-google-analytics/","description":"PWA offer great native alike offline capabilities.

I had the chance to work on some front-end\nand back-end application of [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\"). In\nparticular, I worked with my team to renew the customer area of all the main brands sites:\nvolagratis.com, [lastminute.com](https://www.it.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute\")\nand [rumbo.es](https://www.rumbo.es/ \"rumbo\"). During the last week I did pair programming\nwith [Emanuele Ianni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueleianni/ \"Emanuele Ianni\"). Emanuele is a senior full-stack\nsoftware engineer and a true nerd :alien:/computer science lover :heart:. We needed to implement a new feature for a\nfamily of microservices (based on Java 1.8 and Spring Boot) that make up the back-end of the customer area, both for web\nand mobile apps of [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\"). Unfortunately, we\nfound some legacy code without tests, exactly where we planned to add the feature. At this moment Emanuele showed me the\nGolden master testing technique. So what is golden master testing? As always (and maybe you can expect it because you\nare a huge fan of my blog and you read all my previous posts :laughing:) Wikipedia gives us all the answer we need:\n\n> In computer programming, a **characterization test (also known as Golden Master Testing)** is a means to describe (characterize) the actual behavior of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing behavior of legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing. This term was coined by **Michael Feathers**...... When  creating a characterization test, one must observe what outputs occur for a given set of inputs. Given an observation that the legacy code gives a certain output based on given inputs, then a test can be written that asserts that the output of the legacy code matches the observed result for the given inputs.\n\nSo Golden master testing, mostly know as characterization test, is a technique by which we can be able to put large and\ncomplex legacy code under test: we generated some output given some input for a piece of code, and we write tests in\nwhich we assert that the output from the source code must be the same we received before. In this way we can start to\nrefactor a piece of code and be sure that our modifications didn't change the behaviour of the source code. Whoa!! No\nmore risky approaches to do refactoring without tests!!! :relieved: :clap:  \nNow it's time for an example. In this article I will show you a simple example where I apply this technique to put under\ntest a piece of legacy code. You can find the entire source code\nin [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Golden-Master-Testing-Characterization-Test \"Golden Master Testing Characterization Test repo\")\n.  \nSuppose for example that you found this class, `TravelsAdapter`, in the code you're working on.\n\n```java\npublic class TravelsAdapter {\n    public List<Travel> adapt(JsonNode jsonNode) throws InvalidTravelException {\n        List<Travel> travels = new ArrayList<>();\n        JsonNode payloadNode = jsonNode.with(\"data\");\n        if (payloadNode.findValue(\"orderId\") == null ||\n                StringUtils.isBlank(payloadNode.findValue(\"orderId\").textValue())) {\n            throw new InvalidTravelException(\"Invalid order id\");\n        }\n        long orderId = payloadNode.findValue(\"orderId\").asLong();\n        JsonNode flights = payloadNode.withArray(\"flights\");\n        if (flights.size() == 0) {\n            throw new InvalidTravelException(\"Invalid json (no flights)\");\n        }\n        flights.iterator().forEachRemaining(flight -> {\n            ObjectNode nodeFlight = (ObjectNode) flight;\n            if (nodeFlight.get(\"flightId\") == null || StringUtils.isBlank(nodeFlight.get(\"flightId\").textValue())) {\n                try {\n                    throw new InvalidTravelException(\"Invalid flightNumber value\");\n                } catch (InvalidTravelException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n            String flightNumber = nodeFlight.get(\"flightId\").textValue();\n            String arrivalAirport = nodeFlight.get(\"to\").textValue();\n            String departureAirport = nodeFlight.get(\"from\").textValue();\n            String airline = nodeFlight.get(\"airline\").textValue();\n            travels.add(new Travel(\n                            orderId,\n                            flight.toString(),\n                            flightNumber,\n                            airline,\n                            departureAirport,\n                            arrivalAirport));\n        });\n        return travels;\n    }\n}\n```  \n\nIt's really a mess. So we start to think \"I want to see the tests of this class to understand what it does\", but we\nsearch for them in the project and...there aren't any tests for this class!!! :fearful:. The logic contained in this\nclass seems a little bit twisted, and also it would take a lot of time to write a complete suite of test case because we\nneed to understand from the beginning every single path contained in this class. This is a case where golden master\ntesting could help us.  \nThe first thing we can do is to observe the method returns a list of `Travel` objects. To write our golden master tests\nwe need to find a way to do a comparison between the `Travel` objects returned from the `adapt` method and the one we\nexpect. To do this we can add for example a `toString` method the `Travel` class and test the returned value from it. So\nthe `Travel` class will be the following one.\n\n```java\npublic class Travel {\n    private final long orderId;\n    private final String flights;\n    private final String flightId;\n    private final String airline;\n    private final String departureAirport;\n    private final String arrivalAirport;\n\n    Travel(long orderId,\n           String flights,\n           String flightId,\n           String airline,\n           String departureAirport,\n           String arrivalAirport) {\n        this.orderId = orderId;\n        this.flights = flights;\n        this.flightId = flightId;\n        this.airline = airline;\n        this.departureAirport = departureAirport;\n        this.arrivalAirport = arrivalAirport;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Travel{\" +\n                    \"orderId=\" + orderId + \", \" +\n                    \"flights='\" + flights + '\\'' + \", \" +\n                    \"flightId='\" + flightId + '\\'' + \", \" +\n                    \"airline='\" + airline + '\\'' + \", \" +\n                    \"departureAirport='\" + departureAirport + '\\'' + \", \" +\n                    \"arrivalAirport='\" + arrivalAirport + '\\'' +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we can write some tests and use the output as the expectation. In this way we will be sure that if we start to do\nsome refactoring operation on this class our modification didn't broken any behaviour of the class. So we can do our\nrefactoring with an high level of confidence that everything is working as it was working before our modification :\nrelieved:. To get the output for the test, you can write your test and made them fails, and in the meanwhile log the\nresult so that we can copy it and use it in the next run iteration of our test. The following test is the one we\ngenerated for the class we saw before.\n\n```java\npublic class TravelsAdapterTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void goldenMaster() throws IOException,

Basically we can apply a technique\nnamed **\"property testing\"**: a lot of random input are generated so that there will be an high probability to execute\nall the possible branch in our source code (and in this way have a higher test coverage). So we put our `TravelsAdapter`\nunder test and we can now start to work on this class without any kind of risk :relieved:. Now it's time to test this\ntechnique in your legacy code :grin:.\n","slug":"/2018/03/20/golden-master-test-characterization-test-legacy-code/","description":"In this post I will talk about golden master test aka characterization test: what it is and how to use it.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni","emanuele-ianni"]},"da6278b6-0cde-5fd1-bfde-c38e46c16292":{"title":"Publish your Progressive Web App to the Google Play Store","content":"\n*You can now publish your progressive web apps to the Google Play Store using Trusted Web Activities without writing a\nsingle line of Java/Kotlin code.*\n\n---\n\nA few months ago I [transformed my blog into a Progressive Web App](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/).\nAs you may already know PWA let your websites behaves like a native mobile app but there's one thing that was still\nmissing: the possibility to publish on the App Stores. Because even if a PWA as the advantage to be searchable as a\nstandard website, this days user are used to search for apps on the App Stores for each platform. Well, starting from\nFebruary 2019 this problem has been solved on the Android platform with the release\nof [Trusted Web Activities](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa \"trusted web activities\").  \nIn this post I will show you how I released the PWA of my blog to the Google Play Store using Trusted Web Activities (\nand also without writing a single line of Java/Kotlin code :smirk:).\n\n#### What is a Trusted Web Activity\n\nLet's start from the definition of Trusted Web Activity (TWA) taken\nfrom [the official Google developer website](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa \"trusted web activities\")\n.\n\n> There are a few things that make Trusted Web Activities (TWA) different from other ways to integrate web content with your app:\n>\n> * Content in a Trusted Web activity is trusted -- the app and the site it opens are expected to come from the same developer. (This is verified using Digital Asset Links.)\n> * Trusted Web activities come from the web: they're rendered by the user's browser, in exactly the same way as a user would see it in their browser except they are run fullscreen. Web content should be accessible and useful in the browser first.\n> * Browsers are also updated independent of Android and your app -- Chrome, for example, is available back to Android Jelly Bean. That saves on APK size and ensures you can use a modern web runtime. (Note that since Lollipop, WebView has also been updated independent of Android, but there are a significant number of pre-Lollipop Android users.)\n> * The host app doesn't have direct access to web content in a Trusted Web activity or any other kind of web state, like cookies and localStorage. Nevertheless, you can coordinate with the web content by passing data to and from the page in URLs (e.g. through query parameters, custom HTTP headers, and intent URIs.)\n> * Transitions between web and native content are between activities. Each activity (i.e. screen) of your app is either completely provided by the web, or by an Android activity\n\nSo as you can read above, a Trusted Web Activity let you integrate web content that you personally own into your app and\nlet you execute it into the most modern web runtime (e.g. Chrome) available on the device of the user. Really cool!!! :\nheart_eyes:\n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start to see the real action: how I publish my blog PWA to the Google Play Store using TWA. First of all, I\ncreated a nw android project. This was a standard Android project with minimum API level 16. This let me cover the 99.6%\nof the Android user base. I chose to create an empty project without any activity/fragment in it.\n\n![Create an Android Studio project for your TWA app](../images/posts/pwa-app-01-create-project.jpg)\n\nThen I added the TWA support as a dependency of the app. The TWA implementation is contained inside the custom tabs\nclient library published on [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/ \"Jitpack\") (because unfortunately at the moment of this\nwriting the custom tabs client library contained inside Jetpack doesn't have the TWA support). So I added Jitpack as\nrepository to the project level gradle file. Then I added the custom tabs client library as dependency inside the module\ngradle file. This last dependency points to the custom tabs client library published on github and exposed through\nJitpack. I had to specify a specific commit hash in order to be sure that the library version downloaded contains the\nTWA support. Precisely, I added the following line of code to the gradle file.\n\n```gradle\nimplementation 'com.github.GoogleChrome.custom-tabs-client:customtabs:7a2c1374a3'\n```\n\n![Add jitpack configuration jitpack](../images/posts/pwa-app-02-jitpack-configuration.jpg)\n\n![Add the custom tab library dependencies by pointing to a specific commit](../images/posts/pwa-app-03-java8-and-custom-tab-dependecies.jpg)\n\nAfter the dependencies setup I added the TWA Activity. To do this I just had to modify the Android app manifest file by\ndeclaring a new TWA activity inside it. For the readers that are not mobile developer, the Android app manifest is a\nfile contained in all the Android apps. Its main function is to present essential information about the application to\nthe Android system including:\n\n* the Java package of the app\n* the components of the app including activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers that the app is\n  composed of\n* which permissions the app must have in order to access protected parts of the API\n\nThe declaration of the TWA inside the Android app manifest must include some important information:\n\n* a `meta-data` tag that must contain the url to be opened by the TWA\n* an `intent-filter` that adds the TWA to the Android Launcher\n* another `intent-filter` that allows the TWA to intercept Android Intents that open the url you want to open in the\n  TWA. The `android:host` attribute inside the data tag must point to the domain being opened by the TWA and specified\n  in the `meta-data` tag.\n\n![Add TWA declaration to the app manifest](../images/posts/pwa-app-04-twa-activity-declaration.jpg)\n\nNow I had to establish the link between our PWA website and our PWA app. This is a two way operation because I had to:\n\n* establish an association from app to the website\n* establish an association from the website to the app\n\nThis associations removes automatically the url address bar from the TWA activity. In this way the Android app will be\nfull screen as a standard one (and as a PWA in standalone mode :smirk:).  \nLet's start from the first association, from the app to the web site. To do this I created a new string resource inside\nthe `strings.xml` file. This new string resource contains the Digital AssetLink statement that you can see below.\n\n```xml\n<resources>\n    <string name=\"app_name\">Chicio Coding</string>\n    <string name=\"asset_statements\">\n        [{\n        \\\"relation\\\": [\\\"delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls\\\"],\n        \\\"target\\\": {\n        \\\"namespace\\\": \\\"web\\\",\n        \\\"site\\\": \\\"https://www.fabrizioduroni.it\\\"}\n        }]\n    </string>\n</resources>\n```\n\n![Setup the Digital AssetLink statement in a string resource file](../images/posts/pwa-app-05-associate-app-to-web-1.jpg)\n\nThen I linked this string resource statement inside the Android app manifest by adding a new `meta-data` tag as a child\nof the `application` tag (NOT inside the TWA declaration).\n\n![Add the Digital AssetLink statement to the Android manifest](../images/posts/pwa-app-05-associate-app-to-web-2.jpg)\n\nIt is possible to test that the association from app to the website has been completed. To do this I had to:\n\n* open Chrome on the development device, navigate to `chrome://flags`, search for an item called Enable command line on\n  non-rooted devices and change it to ENABLED and then restart the browser.\n* on the terminal application of your OS, use the Android Debug Bridge (`adb`) to run the following command:\n\n```shell\nadb shell \"echo '_ --disable-digital-asset-link-verification-for-url=\\\"https://www.fabrizioduroni.it\\\"' > /data/local/tmp/chrome-command-line\"\n```\n\nAfter this debug setup the app is launched without the address bar :relieved:.  \nNow I need to finish the development by establishing an association from the website to the app. To do that I needed 2\ninformation about my app:\n\n* the package name\n* SHA-256 Fingerprint\n\nThe first one was easy to get. I just needed to open the Android manifest file and get it. The second piece of\ninformation I needed is inside the keystore that contains the release signing key used to publish the app on the Google\nPlay store. So the first operation I did was to generate a new release signing key. You can find\nthe [standard procedure to get one in this page](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key).\nThe key created was contained inside a keystore file. So in order to be able to extract the SHA-256 fingerprint from the\nkeystore that contains my release signing key I\nused [keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html 'keytool'). You can find the\nexact command I used below. The value for the SHA-256 fingerprint is printed under the Certificate fingerprints section.\n\n```shell\nkeytool -list -v -keystore <your keystore jks file> -alias <your alias> -storepass <your store psw> -keypass <your key psw>\n```\n\nWith both pieces of information at hand I was able to generate a web `assetlink.json` statement using\nthe [asset links generator](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator). The `assetlink.json`\ngenerated must be served from the PWA domain from the URL `<your PWA domain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.\n\n![Generate the assetlinks.json file](../images/posts/pwa-app-07-assetlink-generator.jpg)\n\nAfter publishing the `assetlink.json` to my PWA domain my app was ready to be published to the store. So I followed the\nstandard\nprocedure [to upload an app to the Google Play Store](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/upload-bundle). If\nthe two ways association fails, it is possible to check for error messages using the the Android Debug Bridge, by\nlaunching from the terminal the following command with the test device connected (or the emulator running).\n\n```shell\nadb logcat | grep -e OriginVerifier -e digital_asset_links\n```\n\nNow my blog PWA is published to Google Play store.

Let's see how it is possible to create a microfrontend app by leveraging Webpack 5 module federation with a widget-based custom remote configuration.*\n\n---\n\nAs you may already know from [my previous post](/2022/03/02/custom-jackson-module-deserlializer-serializer-object-mapper-java-spi/), in the last weeks I started to work in a new team on a new project at [lm group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com \"lastminute\"). The goals we have is to renew the foundations of the company software overall architecture by introducing in the development workflow new technologies. While on the backend we defined a clear path to reach our goal from the beginning (DDD + Axon), on the frontend we still had some doubt. In fact the application we are developing, a new booking cancellation flow, will be integrated in our myarea, an app where the user that manage his/her bookings. We decided to develop this new app with React + Styled Components + Our internal design system, that in [lm group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com \"lastminute\") is the standard frontend stack (and is in some way already \"enough\" modern). But there was one problem: coupling between apps.  \nThe myarea app at the moment already loads some widgets (usually associated to specific features) as npm packages. This packages are developed by different teams/external companies. This basically means:\n\n* that if a team want to deploy a new version of their widget, they have to update the package json of the myarea app, tag and release it.\n* there is a coupling between the dependecies of the widgets and of the myarea. This means that you have to keep in sync every dependecy version (eg. do massive React upgrade in every app/widget).\n\nThis was unacceptable. We wanted to be independent with our new \"cancellation widget\", in terms of deployment and dependencies. This why we started to investigate how we can implement a microfrontend architecture for our myarea. What is the microfrontend architecture pattern? Let's see what [micro-frontends.org](https://micro-frontends.org \"microfrontend in action website\") tells us:\n\n> The term Micro Frontends first came up in ThoughtWorks Technology Radar at the end of 2016. It extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world. ... The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.\n\nThe definition is telling us what we already know from the microservice world in the backend: we want to create a frontend application where each team can independently develop and deploy their feature-specific frontend widget/app. Independetly means:\n\n* the apps can have different technology stacks (eg. one app can use React and another one can use Vue as UI framework)\n* the apps run in \"isolations\", they don't need to/they don't have to force the teams to share dependecies between apps\n* the apps can be deployed as standalone: so no need to have one app that declare for example the other one as npm dependecy.\n\nThere are various way to achive the microfrontend architecture, that usually require a lot of custom work/development and/or the usage of specific frameworks (eg. [single-spa](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa \"single-spa\") etc.). With the release of Webpack 5 there is a new game-changer player in the microfrontend world: Module Federation.\nWhat is Module Federation? It is a JavaScript architecture invented by Zack Jackson and Marais Rossouw that is now integrated into Webpack 5 core APIs. Let's read the explanation from Zack about Module Federation:\n\n>A scalable solution to sharing code between independent applications has never been convenient, and near impossible at scale. The closest we had was externals or DLLPlugin, forcing centralized dependency on a external file. It was a hassle to share code, the separate applications were not truly standalone and usually, a limited number of dependencies are shared. Moreover, sharing actual feature code or components between separately bundled applications is unfeasible, unproductive, and unprofitable. ... Module federation allows a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from another application — in the process, sharing dependencies, if an application consuming a federated module does not have a dependency needed by the federated code — Webpack will download the missing dependency from that federated build origin.\nCode is shared if it can be, but fallbacks exist in each case. Federated code can always load its dependencies but will attempt to use the consumers’ dependencies before downloading more payload. Less code duplication, dependency sharing just like a monolithic Webpack build.\n\nSo module federation is a way to let an application dynamically load external parts/widgets/components without \nrelying on the classical npm dependencies management. It lets you build microfrontend application, but without \nsacrifice performances with the shared libraries' mechanism. This seems very cool :rocket:.  \nIn the next section I will show you how me and my colleague Alex Stabile create a new cancellation widget that is integrated in the my area app (the app that lets our users see his/her bookings). Let's start!! :rocket:  \nOne note: the application described above is a simplification of the real stack we have in our codebase. We created this easier example in order to let you focus on the topic of the post.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nAs we said before the applications we are going to work with are 2:\n\n* the first one called `cancel-order`, that is basically a widget that displays a flow where the user can cancel an order\n* another one, called `my-area`, that is an app where the user can manage his/her orders\n\nThe final result we want to achive is integrate the `cancel-order` widget so that when the user click on the cancel button of an order card, the cancellation flow will start. In the video below you can see the final result of the implementation described below.\n\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv6wQrp_K4s`\n\nLet's first see how the two app are composed. Both of them use:\n\n* React\n* [css in js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS-in-JS \"css in js\") framework [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction \"emotion\")\n* [Material UI](https://mui.com \"material ui\") as components library\n\nThe container app, `my-area`, uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com \"react router\") to manage the navigation in the app. Obviously given that we are going to use module federation, both apps are bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).  \nThe `cancel-order` app exposes one widget called `CancelOrderWidget`, that is in charge of displaying and controlling the cancellation flow. Below you can find its (very simple) implementation.\n\n```typescript\nimport {ChangeEvent, FC, useState} from \"react\";\nimport {\n    Button,\n    Container,\n    FormControl,\n    FormControlLabel,\n    FormLabel,\n    Radio,\n    RadioGroup,\n    Typography\n} from \"@mui/material\";\n\ninterface Props {\n    orderId: string;\n}\n\nconst CancelOrderWidget: FC<Props> = ({ orderId }) => {\n    const [disable, setDisable] = useState<boolean>(true);\n\n    const handleChange = (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n        setDisable(event.target.value === \"no\");\n    };\n\n    return <Container sx={{my: 3}}>\n        <Typography variant=\"h3\" color=\"text.primary\">\n            {`Do you really want to cancel order ${orderId}?`}\n        </Typography>\n        <FormControl sx={{my: 3}}>\n            <RadioGroup defaultValue={\"no\"} onChange={handleChange}>\n                <FormControlLabel value=\"yes\" control={<Radio/>} label=\"Yes\"/>\n                <FormControlLabel value=\"no\" control={<Radio/>} label=\"No\"/>\n            </RadioGroup>\n            <Button sx={{my : 2}} disabled={disable} size=\"small\" variant={'contained'} onClick={() => alert(\"Order cancelled\")} color={'error'}>Proceed</Button>\n        </FormControl>\n    </Container>;\n}\n\nexport default CancelOrderWidget;\n```\n\nThe `my-area` app has a main component called `App` where we have all the routes defined. One of these routes contain the `OrdersPage` that displays a list of `OrderCard`s. Each one of them has a button that let the user navigate to the cancel order route where we display the `CancelOrderPage`, that will contain our `CancelOrderWidget` loaded with module federation. Below you can find the code for this components.\n\n```typescript\n// ...App.tsx\n\nconst App: FC = () => (\n    <>\n        <GlobalStyles styles={{body: {margin: 0, padding: 0}}}/>\n        <Header/>\n        <Container sx={{my: 3}}>\n            <BrowserRouter>\n                <Routes>\n                    <Route path=\"/\" element={<OrdersPage orderRepository={new InMemoryOrderRepository()}/>} />\n                    <Route path={\"/:orderId/cancel\"} element={<CancelOrderPage />}/>\n                </Routes>\n            </BrowserRouter>\n        </Container>\n    </>\n);\n\n// ...OrdersPage.tsx\n\ninterface Props {\n    orderRepository: OrderRepository;\n}\n\nexport const OrdersPage: FC<Props> = ({ orderRepository }) =>\n    <>\n        {orderRepository.get().map(order => <OrderCard order={order} key={order.id}/>)}\n    </>\n\n\n// ...OrderCard.tsx\n\n\ninterface Props {\n    order: Order\n}\n\nexport const OrderCard: FC<Props> = ({ order }) =>\n    <Card sx={{ my : 2 }}>\n        <CardMedia\n            component=\"img\"\n            height=\"300\"\n            image=\"https://picsum.photos/1200/300\"\n            alt=\"green iguana\"\n        />\n        <CardContent>\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" color=\"text.primary\">\n                {order.departure} to {order.destination} - {order.date}\n            </Typography>\n        </CardContent>\n        <CardActions>\n            <Button component={Link} to={`/${order.id}/cancel`} size=\"small\" variant={'contained'} color={'error'}>Cancel</Button>\n        </CardActions>\n    </Card>\n\n```\n\nSo how do we intergate the two widgets with Module Federation? Let's find out!! We can start from the `cancel-order` Webpack configuration. The first thing we need to do is import the `ModuleFederationPlugin`. Than we can instantiate it with the correct configuration. In this case we will configurate it with the following parameters:\n\n* `cancelOrderWidget` as `name` of remote module federated. We need to be sure that **every federated module has a unique name with respect to the other**.\n* `remoteEntry.js` as `filename`. This option is used to give a name to the **remote entry file**. In thi file you will find the mapping between between the components exposed and their chunk url.\n* `exposes` parameter will contain a list of all the widgets exposed by this federated module. In our case we are exposing a single component `CancelOrderWidget`, specifing as value the path to it (in our project) and `./CancelOrderWidget` as key.\n* a list of dependecies in the `shared` parameter. This one is used to specify a list of all the libraries that this application will share with other applications in support of files listed in the exposes section. In our case we are telling to the module federation plugin to shared all the dependecies (notice the `...deps`). For `react` and `react-dom` we are sharing the dependecies with a specific override: we are basically telling to the module federation plugin it should not load more than one copy of them. This is a consequence of the fact that these libraries have internal state and multiple instances/versions cannot live in the browser at the same time. We are also specifing which version should be used or try to use a fallback with the `requiredVersion`. Module federation has an internal fallback strategy where it will decide which version of the library should be used bases on it module federate configuration (this is probably a topic for an entire new post :smirk:).\n\nBelow you can find the complete configuration of the `cancel-order` widget.\n\n```javascript\nconst HtmlWebPackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\");\nconst ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\");\n\nconst deps = require(\"./package.json\").dependencies;\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    publicPath: \"http://localhost:3001/\",\n  },\n\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: [\".tsx\", \".ts\", \".jsx\", \".js\", \".json\"],\n  },\n\n  devServer: {\n    port: 3001,\n    historyApiFallback: true,\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.m?js/,\n        type: \"javascript/auto\",\n        resolve: {\n          fullySpecified: false,\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.(css|s[ac]ss)$/i,\n        use: [\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\", \"postcss-loader\"],\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: {\n          loader: \"babel-loader\",\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new ModuleFederationPlugin({\n      name: \"cancelOrderWidget\",\n      filename: \"remoteEntry.js\",\n      exposes: {\n        \"./CancelOrderWidget\": \"./src/components/CancelOrderWidget\"\n      },\n      shared: {\n        ...deps,\n        react: {\n          singleton: true,\n          requiredVersion: deps.react,\n        },\n        \"react-dom\": {\n          singleton: true,\n          requiredVersion: deps[\"react-dom\"],\n        },\n      },\n    }),\n    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({\n      template: \"./src/index.html\",\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nLet's see the configuration for the `my-area` app. Also in this case we need to import the `ModuleFederationPlugin` and configure it in the proper way:\n\n* `myarea` as `name` of the federeated module\n* `remotes` parameter will contain the names of the other federated module applications that this application will consume code from. In our case we will define just one remote, with key `cancelOrder`. This key is the one we will use to reference in the code of the `myarea` app the remote module. As value we will set the name of the remote federate module (the value of the `name` parameter in the `ModuleFederationPlugin` configuration in the `cancel-order` app) followed by the url of the remote entry file of our `cancel-order` app.\n* again, the `shared` parameter with the same approach we used to defined the shared dependecies for the `cancel-order` app.\n\nBelow you can find the entire Webpack configuration for the `my-area` app.\n\n```javascript\nconst HtmlWebPackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\");\nconst ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\"webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\");\nconst ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin = require(\"external-remotes-plugin\");\n\nconst deps = require(\"./package.json\").dependencies;\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    publicPath: \"http://localhost:3000/\"\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: [\".tsx\", \".ts\", \".jsx\", \".js\", \".json\"],\n  },\n  devServer: {\n    port: 3000,\n    historyApiFallback: true,\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.m?js/,\n        type: \"javascript/auto\",\n        resolve: {\n          fullySpecified: false,\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: {\n          loader: \"babel-loader\",\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new ModuleFederationPlugin({\n      name: \"myarea\",\n      remotes: {\n        cancelOrder: 'cancelOrderWidget@[widgets.cancellationOrderWidgetUrl]/remoteEntry.js'\n      },\n      shared: {\n        ...deps,\n        react: {\n          singleton: true,\n          requiredVersion: deps.react,\n        },\n        \"react-dom\": {\n          singleton: true,\n          requiredVersion: deps[\"react-dom\"],\n        },\n      },\n    }),\n    new ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin(),\n    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({\n      template: \"./src/index.html\",\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nNow, if you look closely to the configuration above you noticed something strange:\n\n* the url of the remote entry file is defined as the code below, so webpack expects to find it in some way defined \n  in the placeholder/variable contained in the squared brackets.\n\n```typescript\n  'cancelOrderWidget@[widgets.cancellationOrderWidgetUrl]/remoteEntry.js'\n```\n* we are calling an additional plugin from the module federation world called `ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin`.\n\nThis combination in the configuration will let us define the url of the remote entry file dinamically at runtime when the application starts :heart_eyes:. This is a consequence of the fact that what we defined as \n\n```typescript\n'[widgets.cancellationOrderWidgetUrl]/remoteEntry.js'\n``` \n\nwill be replaced by the `ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin` as `widgets.cancellationOrderWidgetUrl + \"/remoteEntry.js\"`, so a concatenation of a variable, `widgets.cancellationOrderWidgetUrl` that as you can see is defined on the `window` object, plus the fixed part of the url `\"/remoteEntry.js\"` ([here](https://github.com/module-federation/external-remotes-plugin/blob/main/index.js \"ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin\") you can find the source code for the `ExternalTemplateRemotesPlugin` that contains the concatenation described here).  \nThis is absolutely astonishing!! :rocket: This basically means we can have multiple federated module remote entry file urls configurations based on different needs, for example different urls for enviroment (eg. local, qa, production). This also means that we can dinamically update these url and let the `my-area` app configure itself at runtime with a list of urls that represents the latest versions of our federated remote modules :heart_eyes:.  \nHow can we implement it? We can implement a configuration repository that loads a configuration with the list of urls for our federated module. This configuration will be downloaded from the GET api endpoint `'/api/widgets'`. In our case the response will contain just one url for our `cancel-order` federated module. This is the response we will get\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cancellationOrderWidgetUrl\": \"http://localhost:3001\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you remember the configuration for the module federation of the `my-area` app, `cancellationOrderWidgetUrl` corresponds to the last part of the variable `widgets.cancellationOrderWidgetUrl`. o we just need to take this objectstuff received from the configuration and add it to the `window` object.  \nAfter this, we can start our `my-area` app in the right way. Below you can find the implementation of the `loadConfiguration` configuration repository, and how we are using it in the `index.ts`, our app entry point, in order to load the configuration and start the app.\n\n```typescript\n\n// ...Configuration.ts\n\nexport const loadConfiguration = async () => {\n    try {\n        const widgetsResponse = await fetch('/api/widgets');\n        window.widgets = await widgetsResponse.json();\n    } catch (e) {\n        console.error('Error retrieving modules configuration', e);\n    }\n}\n\n// ...index.ts\n\n\nimport {server} from \"./server\";\nimport {loadConfiguration} from \"./logic/Configuration\";\n\nserver()\n\nloadConfiguration().then( () => {\n    import(\"./App\");\n})\n```\n\nAt this point we have everything we need in place in order to load our remote federated module. To do this we will load the `CancelOrderWidget` as a standard dynamic component using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. The import path for the widget is `cancelOrder/CancelOrderWidget`, that correspond to the `key` defined in the `remotes` section of the `my-area` webpack configuration plus the name of the widget as defined in the `exposes` section fo the `cancel-order` webpack configuration. As a consequence of the fact that the widget is not available in our `node_modules`, neither its types, we must define them manually.  \nAfter the last bits of code below, we will finally able to start our, and we will have the same result show in the video at the beginning of this explanation.\n\n```typescript\n\n// ...CancelOrderWidget.d.ts\n\ndeclare module 'cancelOrder/CancelOrderWidget' {\n    const CancelOrderWidget: React.FC<{ orderId: string; }>;\n\n    export = CancelOrderWidget;\n}\n\n\n// ...CancelOrderPage.tsx\n\nimport React, {FC, Suspense} from \"react\";\nimport {useParams} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nconst CancelOrderWidget = React.lazy(() => import(\"cancelOrder/CancelOrderWidget\"));\n\ntype UrlParams = {\n  orderId: string;\n}\n\nexport const CancelOrderPage: FC = () => {\n  const { orderId } = useParams<UrlParams>();\n\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div/>}>\n      <CancelOrderWidget orderId={orderId ?? \"\"}/>\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn this [Github repository](https://github.com/chicio/module-federation-react-example \"module federation react example\") you can find the implementation fo the example described above. Module federation is relatively young feature of Webpack, but seems that can help a lot of developers to reach the goal of implementing a clean micro frontend architecture :heart:. What do you think?

Current extends SantaClaus\n      ? PreviousElements[\"length\"]\n      : SearchOnRow<Others, [...PreviousElements, Current]>\n    : false\n\ntype CurrentPosition<Maze extends MazeItem[][], PreviousRows extends MazeItem[][] = []> = \n  Maze extends [infer CurrentRow extends MazeItem[], ...infer OtherRows extends MazeItem[][]]\n    ? SearchOnRow<CurrentRow> extends false \n      ? CurrentPosition<OtherRows, [...PreviousRows, CurrentRow]>\n      : [PreviousRows['length'], SearchOnRow<CurrentRow>]\n    : never;\n\ntype NewPosition<Maze extends MazeItem[][], NextMove extends Directions> = \n  CurrentPosition<Maze> extends [infer RowPosition extends number, infer ColumnPosition extends number] \n    ? UpdatedPositionFor<NextMove, RowPosition, ColumnPosition> \n    : never;\n```\n\nGiven the next position from the type above, I was ready to create the `Update` type.\nThis is very similar to what I have already shown saw in the [previous articles](/2024/01/20/advent-of-typescript-2023-connect-4/): I loop over the maze matrix and I place Santa in the cell \ncorresponding to `NextMovePosition`.\nThe only new thing here is `RemoveSantaFromRow`, a type that remove Santa from the cell if it doesn't match the one \ncontained in `NextMovePosition`.\n\n```typescript\ntype RemoveSantaFromRow<Row extends MazeItem[]> = {\n    [Index in keyof Row]: Row[Index] extends SantaClaus ?

Let's see how I grouped \nthem and run them against multiple configurations with Xcode Test Plan.*\n\n---\n\nIf you look at my [Github profile](https://github.com/chicio \"fabrizio duroni github profile\"), you can see that one of\nmy most starred open source project is [RangeUISlider](https://github.com/chicio/RangeUISlider \"rangeslider ios\"): an\niOS range selection slider compatible with UIKit and SwiftUI. I developed it using autolayout and it is highly\ncustomizable (thanks to IBDesignabled and IBInspectable or programmatic property access.  \nIn the last month I did a big refactoring on its code base so that I can add features quickly and improved the code\nquality. I also received some new feature request on github. In particular one\nuser [was asking for Right To Left Languages (RTL) support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left \"right to left language\")\n. There was one problem with these activities: there were basically no Unit or UI tests. This means that each one of\nthese activities was scaring and I had to manually test all the RAngeUISlider features. So I decided to add the tests\nneeded but two problems arise:\n\n- the tests suite was slow. Just with the first few UI tests the execution of the entire tests suite was a pain in the\n  ass :weary:. Given the fact that I wanted a quick feedback after each small steps of refactoring, this was not an\n  ideal setup.\n- one as I told you, one of the latest feature I added was the support for RTL languages. To test this feature I just\n  wanted to run the UI test I already wrote but with a different device configuration: I wanted to run them on devices\n  configured with a RTL languages.\n\nSo I started to wonder if there was a solution to these problems, and then I remembered a video I saw on my Apple TV in\nthe Apple Developer app the last year: Test Plans. What are they? Test plans are a new feature of Xcode that let you run\na subset of you tests (Unit or UI tests) against multiple configuration. They are defined using the `.xctestplan` file\nformat and they are already supported by `xcodebuild` command line execution and Xcode server/CI.  \nAs you can see from the definition this is exaclty what I needed for RangeUISlider. So in this post I will show you how\nI setup the test plans for RangeUISlider and I had been able to refactor its entire code base in a safe way by running\nthe subset of tests needed to check my changes for the specific part of code I was working on and test it against\nmultiple configurations. Let's start!! :rocket:\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe first thing to do in order to be able to use Test Plans is enable for your scheme. Obviously, in my case I enabled\nthem for the `RangeUISlider` framework scheme. To do that you have to:\n\n* go in the scheme selection panel and click on `Edit schemes` while your target is selected\n* go to the test phase and click on the button in the bottom right corner `Convert to use Test Plans`\n\n![Convert your scheme tests to Test Plan](../images/posts/test-plans-button.jpg)\n\nAfter that you will see a new window where you can choose how to create your first test plan. In my case I chose to\ncreate an empty test plan and I clicked on continue.\n\n![Create an empty Test Plan](../images/posts/test-plans-choose.jpg)\n\nWhen I converted the `RangeUISlider` tests to use test plan I had the following tests in place:\n\n* a set of unit tests suites\n* some UI test suites to test all the behavioural features (e.g. custom scale, step increment, SwiftUI integration etc.)\n  You can find this test in the `MixedFeatureTest`, `InsideTableViewTests` and `SwiftUITests` test classes (see the\n  repository link at the beginning of this post).\n* some UI test suites to test the programmatic setup features (e.g. programmatic scale change, knob starting and current\n  position). You can find this tests inside the `ProgrammaticDefaultKnobValueChangeTests`, `ProgrammaticKnobChangeTests`\n  and `ProgrammaticScaleChangeTests` test classes.\n\nAs you can understand from the list above, these are three group of separated tests types that I want to execute\nindipendently based on the code piece I'm working on. So I decided to create 3 test plans.  \nThe first one is `UnitTestPlan.xctestplan`. In this test plan I added all the unit tests I had at the time in order to\nbe able to execute them when I modify a piece of code that is related to all the collaborators that contains the logic\nrelated to the range selected or the step increment calculations. This basically means that test target launched by the\ntest plan is `RangeUISliderTests`. These tests are executed with a single configuration. They can be executed in\nparallel so I checked also the option `Execute in parallel (if possible)`. I also wanted that new tests added to this\nsuite should be added automatically to this test plan, so I checked the `Automatically include new tests` option.\n\n![The UnitTestPlan](../images/posts/test-plan-unit.jpg)\n\nThe second test plan I created is `ProgrammaticChangesTestPlan.xctestplan`. As you can imagine in this test plan I added\nall the test related to the RangeUISlider programmatic setup features. In particular at the moment of the creation of\nthe test plan I had 3 test suite that should be contained in this test plan: `ProgrammaticDefaultKnobValueChangeTests`\n, `ProgrammaticKnobChangeTests` and `ProgrammaticScaleChangeTests`. These are all UI test, so in this case the test\ntarget launched by the test plan is `RangeUISliderUITests`. For this plan I *unchecked*\nthe `Automatically include new tests` option, because I want add new test suites to this test plan only if they can be\nclassified as related to programmatic features.\n\n![The ProgrammaticChangesTestPlan](../images/posts/test-plan-programmatic.jpg)\n\nThe third test plan I created is `BehaviourTestPlan.xctestplan`. In this test plan I added all the behavioural UI test\nsuites I wrote for RangeUISlider: `MixedFeaturesTests`, `InsideTableViewTests` and `SwiftUITests`. These are again all\nUI tests so the test target launched by the test plan is `RangeUISliderUITests`. This test plan contains the tests\nrelated to all the core features of RangeUISlider: knobs movement, range selection, custom scale etc. This feature\nshould be tested against multiple configuration because, as I said before, RangeUISlider supports the RTL text. Test\nplans let you define multiple configuration for the same test. This basically means that the tests included in a test\nplan with multiple configuration will be execute multiple times, one for each configuration defined. So, for\nthe `BehaviourTestPlan.xctestplan` test plan I defined two configuration, one with a simulated left to right language\nand the other one with the right to left language. In the screenshots below you can find the entire configuration.\n\n![The BehaviourTestPlan tests](../images/posts/test-plan-behaviour-tests.jpg)\n\n![The BehaviourTestPlan configurations](../images/posts/test-plan-behaviour-configuration.jpg)\n\nLast but not least I created a last test plan called `AllTestPlan.xctestplan` where I added all tests from all the test\ntargets and I can use it to have a feedback when my change is spread across the logic, behaviour and UI.  \nSo how can I set which test plan I want to run? In the `Test` section of the `Edit Scheme` screen you can choose the\ndefault test plan to be run with the `cmd + U` option. In this way you can change based on the piece of code you're\nworking on.\n\n![The default test plan is launched with the classic cmd + U shortcut](../images/posts/test-plan-set-default.jpg)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nTest plan are the perfect tool that let you organize your tests in a better way. They will enable you to test only the\napplication/framework part you're working on in order to have a faster tests feedback loop. So in case you need a range\nsllider component, go on `RangeUISlider` github repository and check it out!! :sunglasses:.

I think it's one of the most beautiful javascript and computer graphics library out there. Don't you\nknow what three.js is? Let's see the description from\nthe [official github repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/ \"official threejs github repo\"):\n\n> JavaScript 3D library. The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library. The library provides canvas, svg, CSS3D and WebGL renderers.\n\nSimple and clear (I love this kind of definition :relieved:). Three.js is a library built on top of WebGL aiming to\nsimplify the computer graphics development for the web. It has a lot of different features, including the support\nfor [Physically Based Rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering \"Physically Based Rendering\").\nLet's see the potential of this library. In this post I will show you how to create a simple physically base scene. At\nthe end of this post you will have a scene like the one in the following image:\n\n![The 3D scene that you will get at the end of the following tutorial on threejs](../images/posts/threejs-scene.jpg)\n\nThe mesh We will use are a simplified version of the ones available from\nthe [Stanford scan repository](https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/\n\"Stanford scan repository\") in PLY format.  \nLet's start from the setup. We can use a simple html page, similar to the one described in the three.js doc (shown\nbelow). We will put our assets (mesh, textures etc.) in the folder `/assets/models`.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>My first three.js app</title>\n  <style>\n    body {\n      margin: 0;\n    }\n\n    canvas {\n      width: 100%;\n      height: 100%\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<script src=\"js/three.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  // Our Javascript will go here.\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe first thing we will need to create is a `Scene`. We will also need to create a `Camera`, a `TextureLoader` for\ntexture loading, a `PLYLoader` to load our PLY meshes and a `WebGLRenderer`. Finally we will need an instance\nof `OrbitControls`, a three.js extension that we use to orbit around the scene.\n\n```javascript\nvar scene = new THREE.Scene();\nvar camera = createCamera();\nvar textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();\nvar plyLoader = new THREE.PLYLoader();\nvar renderer = createRenderer();\nvar controls = createOrbitsControls(camera, renderer);\n```\n\nFor the camera, we create a `PerspectiveCamera`. As the name says, it uses\nthe [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection \"perspective projection\")\nto simulate the human eye views (this is one of the two main camera type used in computer graphics along\nwith [orthogonal projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Orthographic_projection \"orthogonal projection\")\n. We place the camera in front of the scene, and we set the\nvertical [field of view FOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view_in_video_games \"field of view FOV\") of the\nviewing frustum to 75 degrees, the aspect ratio using the current width and height of the window,\nthe [near and far plane of the viewing frustum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum \"near and far plane of the viewing frustum\")\nrespectively to 0.1 and 1000 (to avoid the discard of mesh added to the scene).\n\n```javascript\nfunction createCamera() {\n\n  var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\n  camera.position.z = 8;\n  camera.position.y = 0;\n  camera.position.x = 0;\n\n  return camera;\n}\n```\n\nWe create a renderer with the alpha property set to true, in case we want to integrate in another HTML page and we want\nthe background to be visible until the scene is loaded. We set\nthe [gamma correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction \"gamma correction\") for input and output colors by\nsettings the properties `gammaInput` and `gammaOutput` to true. We also enable shadow mapping by\nsetting `shadowMap.enabled` to true, setting it to use\nthe [percentage closer filtering](https://fabiensanglard.net/shadowmappingPCF/ \"percentage closer filtering\")\nwith [bilinear filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_filtering \"bilinear filtering\"). Finally we set the\nsize of the renderer to the same size of the window where we will display the scene.\n\n```javascript\nfunction createRenderer() {\n\n  var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ alpha: true });\n  renderer.physicallyCorrectLights = true;\n  renderer.gammaInput = true;\n  renderer.gammaOutput = true;\n  renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;\n  renderer.shadowMap.bias = 0.0001;\n  renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap;\n  renderer.setSize($(window).width(), $(window).height());\n\n  return renderer;\n}\n```\n\nNext we setup the `OrbitControls` instance to manage an automatic rotation around the scene. You can customize this\nfunction to let the user manage the movement with keyboard or touch control (on mobile :iphone:).\n\n```javascript\nfunction createOrbitsControls(camera, renderer) {\n\n  var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);\n  controls.enableZoom = false;\n  controls.autoRotate = true;\n  controls.enablePan = false;\n  controls.keyPanSpeed = 7.0;\n  controls.enableKeys = false;\n  controls.target = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0);\n  controls.mouseButtons = {};\n  controls.dispose();\n\n  return controls;\n}\n```\n\nNow we can add the renderer to the DOM (we attach it to the body) of the page. We can now start to customize the scene\nby setting the background color to indaco (0x303F9F) (remember: the recommended way to set color in three.js is by HEX\nvalue). We can then add the main light and the hemisphere light.\n\n```javascript\n//Add rendering dom element to page.\ndocument.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n\n//Setup scene.\nscene.background = new THREE.Color(0x303F9F);\nscene.add(createLight());\nscene.add(createHemisphereLight());\n```\n\nWe create the main light as a point light using the `PointLight` class. In the constructor we set its color to white,\nits intensity to 1 (default), 20 for the distance from the light where the intensity is 0, and finally the decay to 2 (\nthis is the amount the light dims along the distance of the light, and [must be set to 2 for physically base light](\nhttps://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/lights/PointLight \"PointLight doc\")).  \nWe then set its power as the same of a 100 Watt\nbulb ([1700 Lumen](http://www.power-sure.com/lumens.htm \"Lumen cheatsheet\")) light and we place it above the scene, to\ncreate some sort of street light effect (light beam from above). We also active the ability to cast generate shadow by\nsetting `castShadow` to true, we force the shadow map size to 512x512 pixel (to increase performance, as the default is\n\n1024) and we give a little blur on the shadow by setting the `radius` property to 1.5. We also create a geometry and a\n      material for the light:\n\n* the geometry is a sphere with radius 0\n* the material is a complete emissive physically based material\n\nIn fact, the `MeshStandardMaterial` is the three.js implementation of a physically based material (so it's real:\nthree.js rocks with physically based rendering :open_mouth:).\n\n```javascript\nfunction createLight() {\n\n  var lightGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0);\n\n  var lightMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({\n    emissive: 0xffffee,\n    emissiveIntensity: 1,\n    color: 0x000000\n  });\n\n  var light = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 20, 2);\n  light.power = 1700;\n  light.castShadow = true;\n  light.shadow.mapSize.width = 512;\n  light.shadow.mapSize.heigth = 512;\n  light.shadow.radius = 1.5;\n\n  light.add(new THREE.Mesh(lightGeometry, lightMaterial));\n  light.position.set(0, 5, 3);\n\n  return light;\n}\n```\n\nFor the hemisphere light, we create it using the `HemisphereLight` class. We set the sky color to dark blue (0x303F9F),\nthe ground color to black (0x000000) and its intensity to 1.\n\n```javascript\nfunction createHemisphereLight() {\n\n  return new THREE.HemisphereLight(0x303F9F, 0x000000, 1);\n}\n```\n\nNow we can start to add the stars, the PLY mesh models and the floor mesh model. Each mesh model is added to the scene\nat the end of its load method.\n\n```javascript\n//Load models.\nloadStars(textureLoader, function(stars) {\n\n  scene.add(stars);\n});\n\nloadPlyModelUsingPhysicalMaterial(\n  plyLoader,\n  'assets/models/lucy.ply',\n  {\n    color: 0x3F51B5,\n    roughness: 0.5,\n    metalness: 0.7,\n    clearCoat: 0.5,\n    clearCoatRoughness: 0.5,\n    reflectivity: 0.7\n  },\n  new THREE.Vector3(3, -3, 0),\n  new THREE.Vector3(0, -Math.PI / 3.0, 0),\n  function(mesh) {\n\n    scene.add(mesh);\n  }\n);\n\nloadPlyModelUsingPhysicalMaterial(\n  plyLoader,\n  'assets/models/dragon.ply',\n  {\n    color: 0x448AFF,\n    roughness: 0.1,\n    metalness: 0.9,\n    clearCoat: 0.0,\n    clearCoatRoughness: 0.2,\n    reflectivity: 1\n  },\n  new THREE.Vector3(-3, -3, 0),\n  new THREE.Vector3(0, -Math.PI, 0),\n  function(mesh) {\n\n    scene.add(mesh);\n  }\n);\n\nloadPlyModelUsingPhysicalMaterial(\n  plyLoader,\n  'assets/models/bunny.ply',\n  {\n    color: 0xCCFFFF,\n    roughness: 0.9,\n    metalness: 0.1,\n    clearCoat: 0.0,\n    clearCoatRoughness: 0.5,\n    reflectivity: 0.1\n  },\n  new THREE.Vector3(0, -3, 1.5),\n  new THREE.Vector3(0, -Math.PI, 0),\n  function(mesh) {\n\n    scene.add(mesh);\n  }\n);\n\nloadFloor(textureLoader, function(mesh) {\n\n  scene.add(mesh);\n});\n```\n\nFor the stars, we use the `textureLoader` to load a circle png texture. When the texture load is completed, we create a\nlot of `Geometry` objects with random position. We also create the material using the texture obtained from the loader (\nand we set on it a transparent background). Now we can create some `Points` objects using the specific three.js class.\n\n```javascript\nfunction loadStars(textureLoader, completeLoad) {\n\n  textureLoader.load(\"assets/models/textures/circle.png\", function(texture) {\n\n    var starsGeometry = new THREE.Geometry();\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {\n\n      var star = new THREE.Vector3();\n      star.x = 2000 * Math.random() - 1000;\n      star.y = 2000 * Math.random();\n      star.z = 2000 * Math.random() - 1000;\n\n      starsGeometry.vertices.push(star)\n    }\n\n    var starsMaterial = new THREE.PointsMaterial({\n      color: 0x888888,\n      map: texture,\n      transparent: true,\n    });\n\n    var stars = new THREE.Points(starsGeometry, starsMaterial);\n\n    completeLoad(stars);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nFor the PLY models, we use the PLY loader to obtain the corresponding geometry. Then we create a `MeshPhysicalMaterial`\nusing the parameters received. We also set the position and rotation of the mesh and we force the update of the local\ntransform using the `updateMatrix()` method. We set `castShadow` to true, as we need that this meshes are considered in\nshadow mapping. We finally set also `matrixAutoUpdate` to false, as we don't need to recalculate the position of the\nmesh on each frame (our meshes are static).\n\n```javascript\nfunction loadPlyModelUsingPhysicalMaterial(plyLoader, path, parameters, position, rotation, completeLoad) {\n\n  plyLoader.load(path, function(geometry) {\n\n    var material = new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial(parameters);\n    var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);\n    mesh.position.set(position.x, position.y, position.z);\n    mesh.rotation.set(rotation.x, rotation.y, rotation.z);\n    mesh.castShadow = true;\n    mesh.matrixAutoUpdate = false;\n    mesh.updateMatrix();\n\n    completeLoad(mesh);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nFor the floor, we use again the `textureLoader` to load a texture of a marble surface. We then set the `wrapS`\nand `wrapT`  property to `RepeatWrapping`, to have the texture repeated on the entire surface. We then create\na `MeshStandardMaterial`, that is the base material for `MeshPhysicalMaterial`, and so it is also a physically based\nmaterial. We finally set also here the position, rotation and `matrixAutoUpdate` to false.\n\n```javascript\nfunction loadFloor(textureLoader, completionFunction) {\n\n  textureLoader.load(\"assets/models/textures/marble.jpg\", function(texture) {\n\n    texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;\n    texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;\n    texture.repeat.set(100, 100);\n\n    var floorMat = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({\n      roughness: 0.7,\n      metalness: 0.1,\n      map: texture\n    });\n\n    var floorGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(1000, 1000);\n    var floorMesh = new THREE.Mesh(floorGeometry, floorMat);\n    floorMesh.receiveShadow = true;\n    floorMesh.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2.0;\n    floorMesh.position.y = -3;\n    floorMesh.matrixAutoUpdate = false;\n    floorMesh.updateMatrix();\n\n    completionFunction(floorMesh);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nWe are ready to render our scene. We just need to create\nthe [rendering loop](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html \"rendering loop\") with the following code:\n\n```javascript\nvar render = function() {\n\n  requestAnimationFrame(render);\n  controls.update();\n  renderer.render(scene, camera);\n};\n```\n\nYou can find the entire scene code is [this github gist](https://gist.github.com/chicio/af13397f22c21a05b6ac007c83f84403).  \nYeah!!!

In the Friyay everyone can learn and improve his/her skill on any subject. In particular, as you seen \nfrom one of my [previous post](/2022/06/06/microfrontend-module-federation-dynamic-configuration/ \"module \nfederation\"), I spent some Friyay putting in place the first microfrontend architecture for the customer \narea of lastminute.com websites (while also trying to study in deep some other topics).  \nIn the last weeks I started a new Friyay \"secret\" project with my colleague \n[Marco De Lucchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcodelucchi/). As you may already remember [I already worked with \nMarco](/2020/01/18/react-native-activate-hermes/ \"react native hermes\") in the past when I was part of the mobile app \nteam.\nFor this new secret project, we are developing something new for our mobile app \nusing [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/ \"swiftui\"). We had various challenges to overcome. \nOne of this has been to be able to display a cool inspirational title like the following one.\n\n![swiftui path shapes](../images/posts/swiftui-path.jpg \"The inspirational title we want to create\")\n\nThe easiest way to go could be to simply include in the target bundle the localized version of an assets that \nrepresent the title above. This is easily achievable using \n[Xcode localized assets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-assets-in-a-catalog \"xcode \nlocalized assets\"). But given that we were already having fun with SwiftUI (remember, it is a Friyay project \n:laughing: ) and that we want to save bytes on the bundle size (that is always important), we decided to be bold and \ntry to implement the title in the screenshot above using only code (no assets).  \nSo in this post we will show you our own personal journey into the world of SwiftUI `Path` and `Shape` and how we \nhave been able to create the inspirational title in the screenshot above using only code. Let's go!! :rocket:\n\n#### Implementation\n\nLet's start from the most challenging part: the background. As you can see from the image above it is \nbasically the same shape drawn twice, one above each other, with different color and a slightly different position \nin space. In the original Figma we received from UX we were able to extract the svg path coordinates for these shapes.  \nSo how can we draw them in SwiftUI? We can use [Path](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/path \n\"swiftui path\") and [Shape](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shape \"swiftui shape\"). The first one \nis a `struct` that represents the outline of a 2D shape in terms of a set of point and their connection. The second \none is a protocol that contains one specific method required `func path(in: CGRect) -> Path`: by implementing it we \nmust return a `Path` that describe the outline of the `Shape` itself in the current reference `Rect`, that can change \nbased on the usage context of the `Shape` itself.  \nSo given the svg coordinate that I mentioned before, we can create a component named `TitleBackgroundShape` that \nimplement the `Shape` protocol that draws the path described by the svg. To quickly convert the svg path into code \nwe used [https://swiftvg.mike-engel.com](https://swiftvg.mike-engel.com \"swift svg path\"). This tool transformed our \ntwo svg path as the following `UIBezierPath`. \n\n```swift\n// ...other code...\n\nprivate var whitePath: UIBezierPath {\n    let shape = UIBezierPath()\n    shape.move(to: CGPoint(x: 247, y: 15.79))\n    shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 8.72, y: 21))\n    shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 2, y: -2.08))\n    shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 245.12, y: -3))\n    shape.close()\n    return shape\n}\nprivate var purplePath: UIBezierPath {\n    let shape = UIBezierPath()\n    shape.move(to: CGPoint(x: 245, y: 18.79))\n    shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 6.72, y: 24))\n    shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0.92))\n    shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 243.12, y: 0))\n    shape.close()\n    return shape\n}\n    \n// ...other code...    \n```\n\nGiven the paths above a first naive implementation of the `TitleBackgroundShape` component could be the following.\n\n```swift\nprivate struct TitleBackgroundShape: Shape {\n    private let path: UIBezierPath\n    \n    init(path: UIBezierPath) {\n        self.path = path\n    }\n    \n    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {\n        return Path(path.cgPath)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSeems easy, but of course there is a problem: if you look carefully at the svg path above, you will notice that it \nis defined for some specific dimension. Generally speaking, even if we export the svg with coordinate system define \nbetween 0 and 1 on each axis, we still need to find a way to scale the path correctly with respect to the current \nframe we are drawing into, represented by the `rect` parameter of the `func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path` function. \nHow can we do this? There are \n[affine transforms](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/401/notes/affines-matrices.pdf \"affine transform\") to \nthe rescue!! \n:rocket: They are very useful (and also used a lot in computer graphics :laughing: ) geometric linear transform that \npreserve co-linearity and parallelism. The affine transform matrix for \n2D scaling expressed as [homogenous coordinates](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~dhouse/courses/401/notes/affines-matrices.pdf \"affine transform\") is the following one.\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nS_{x} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_{y} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\cdot S_{x}\\\\\ny \\cdot S_{y} \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nGuess what? Inside the `Core Graphics` framework we already have the `CGAffineTransform` struct with various init \nmethods, one for each type of transform (rotate, scale and translation, but shear seems missing for unknown reasons \n:laughing: ).\nIn our case we will use `CGAffineTransform(scaleX: <value>, y: <value>)`. Which are the value to be used as scale factor? \nFor our goal we need to calculate the ratio between the `rect` parameter of the `func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path` \nfunction (that as we said before it is the `CGRect` in which we are drawing our shape) and the bounding rect of the \npath itself. Luckily, SwiftUI exposes a beautiful `boundingRect` property on the `Path` that is exactly what we need.\nSo in the end the final implementation of our `TitleBackgroundShape` is the following one.\n\n```swift\nprivate struct TitleBackgroundShape: Shape {\n    private let path: UIBezierPath\n    \n    init(path: UIBezierPath) {\n        self.path = path\n    }\n    \n    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {\n        let path = Path(path.cgPath)\n        return path.applying(\n            CGAffineTransform(\n                scaleX: rect.width / path.boundingRect.width,\n                y: rect.height / path.boundingRect.height\n            )\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow that we have our shape, we need to draw it twice with the two svg paths we saw above. We can draw them in a \n`ZStack` in order to have the white one as overlay of the purple one. This is the final implementation of our shape \ncomponents that we will call `TitleBackground`.\n\n```swift\nstruct TitleBackground: View {\n    private var whitePath: UIBezierPath {\n        let shape = UIBezierPath()\n        shape.move(to: CGPoint(x: 247, y: 15.79))\n        shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 8.72, y: 21))\n        shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 2, y: -2.08))\n        shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 245.12, y: -3))\n        shape.close()\n        return shape\n    }\n    private var purplePath: UIBezierPath {\n        let shape = UIBezierPath()\n        shape.move(to: CGPoint(x: 245, y: 18.79))\n        shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 6.72, y: 24))\n        shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0.92))\n        shape.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 243.12, y: 0))\n        shape.close()\n        return shape\n    }\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        ZStack(alignment: Alignment.topLeading) {\n            TitleBackgroundShape(path: purplePath)\n                .fill(Color(\"SecondaryColor\"))\n            TitleBackgroundShape(path: whitePath)\n                .fill(Color(\"TextColor\"))\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLast but not least, for the message text we can use a standard `Text` component. As you can see from the image above it \nis a white bold text (represented in the example as `SecondaryText`). If you look  at it carefully, you will notice that \nit is slightly rotate. In fact checking the Figma design we received from UX, we discovered that it has a 1.\n38-degree rotation. This is why we used the `.rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: -1.38))` modifier. We also want our text \nalways on 1 line (forcing it to be truncated in some exceptional cases) and centered with the `.lineLimit(1)` and `.\nmultilineTextAlignment(.center)` modifiers.  \nAs you can see again from the initial image, we want also a specific padding around our text, in order to have some \nspace with respect to the background. This is why we added the three `.padding` modifiers in order to have specific \nspacing for each side.  \nWe are finally ready to add the custom background  component `TitleBackground` we created before. We need to put it \nbehind the text, but we want also to see it grows proportionally to the text dimension. This is why we included the \n`Text` component in a `ZStack`, and we added with the `.background` modifier the `TitleBackground`. Below you can find \nthe implementation.\n\n```swift\nstruct InspirationaTitle: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        ZStack {\n            Text(LocalizedStringKey(\"It's event better when you get there!\"))\n                .foregroundColor(Color(\"SecondaryColor\"))\n                .fontWeight(.bold)\n                .minimumScaleFactor(0.4)\n                .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: -1.38))\n                .lineLimit(1)\n                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)\n                .padding(.leading, 12)\n                .padding(.trailing, 4)\n                .padding(.bottom, 8)\n        }\n        .background(TitleBackground())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn this [github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Path-Example \"swiftui path example\") you can find the \nimplementation fo the example described above. I'm really excited to share with you in the next weeks the entire \nproject where we used the implementation above.

I also always though that what makes a real professional software\ndeveloper is how much he/she care about the software he/she is creating: the approach to the problem, the attention to\ndetails in code, the passion put into creating every single line of code, the focus on the mission to solve his/her\ncustomer problems with your software.  \nWhen I started to work at [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ \"lastminute.com group\") I discovered\nthat I'm not the only one to think about software development in this way.  \nIn fact an entire new approach to software development has been create\nby [Robert Cecil Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin \"Robert Cecil Martin\"), known as \"Uncle\nBob\" (what??!?!!? :stuck_out_tongue:) and famous also to be the guy that invented\nthe [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) \"Solid principles\"). The name of\nthis new approach to software development is **clean code**.  \nSo as I promised in [my first post](/2017/05/10/about-me/ \"about me\") on this blog I will publish a series of\narticles in which I will talk about the foundation of clean code and my personal experiences with it. So let's start the\ndiscussion with one of the principles of clean code that impressed me the most: meaningful naming.\n\n![Remember: you NEED to choose your names carefully!](../images/posts/meaningful-names.jpg \"Remember: you NEED to choose your names carefully!\")\n\nAs stated by Uncle Bob in the beautiful meme above, this principle is simple: choose your name carefully. But what does\nit really mean to \"choose carefully\"? :confused:. Choosing the right names means the following thing:\n\n* **Names should reveal intent.** Names should answer why a variable, a class or a method exists, what it does and how\n  it must be used.\n* **Avoid disinformation.** Names should not contains false clues about the scope of a variable, method or class. Taking\n  an example from Uncle Bob's clean code: \"Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList, unless it is\n  actually a list...So accountGroups or just plain accounts would be better\".\n* **Don't use noise words.** Adding in the name something like \"Info\" , \"Data\" doesn't give you any value.\n* **Use pronounceable names.** This is simple: use names that humans can pronounce without feeling stupid.\n* **Use searchable names.** Avoid single-letter names and numeric constants that make your components harder to find.\n* **Avoid encodings.** Avoid unnecessary encoding notation, like for\n  example [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation \"Hungarian Notation\") in which the name\n  of a variable or function indicates its type.\n* **Avoid member prefix.** Don't add unnecessary name prefix.\n* **Avoid encoding interface and implementations.** Avoid encoding interface with \"I\" and concrete implementation with \"\n  Impl\". If you really need to encode, do it for the implementation.\n* **Use noun or noun phrase for classes.**\n* **Use verb or verb phrase for methods.**\n* **One word per concept.** Choose a word for a concept and always use it each time you have to refer to it in code.\n* **Use solution domain names.** Your code will be read by other programmers. Math names, algorithm names, pattern names\n  are all good choices.\n* **Use problem domain names.** If no \"programmer oriented name\" exists, go with names taken from the problem domain.\n\nLet's see an example to understand the real value of naming classes, methods, functions and variable in the right way.\nFor example, take a look at the following C++ code:\n\n```c++\nstruct pt {\n    float x;\n    float y;\n    float z;\n};\n\nstruct mt {\npublic:\n    float m[4][4];\n};\n\nclass Obj {\npublic:\n    bool act;\n    mt matr;\n    std::vector<pt> ms;\n};\n\nclass GameManager {\npublic:\n\n    GameManager(std::vector<Obj> anObjList){\n        objList = anObjList;\n    }\n\n    std::vector<Obj> get() {\n        std::vector<Obj> newObjList;\n        for (auto currObj : newObjList) {\n            if (currObj.act && currObj.ms.size() > 0) {\n                newObjList.push_back(currObj);\n            }\n        }\n        return newObjList;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    std::vector<Obj> objList;\n};\n```\n\nEven if you can maybe get a feeling of what is going, it's hard to really understand all the details of this code, and\nevery class, struct is supposed to do and to represent. What are `pt` and `mt`???? What is supposed to represent\na `GameManager` and an `Obj`? And the method `get`, what wants to get????? :cold_sweat:. You can see that a lot of\nthings are a little bit obscure in this code.  \nWe can try to refactor it following the names guidelines we exposed above. Do you think the code will improve in this\nway? You can judge it by yourself:\n\n```c++\nstruct Point {\n    float x;\n    float y;\n    float z;\n};\n\nstruct Matrix {\npublic:\n    float values[4][4];\n};\n\nclass GameObject {\npublic:\n    bool isActive;\n    Matrix transformation;\n    std::vector<Point> mesh;\n};\n\nclass Scene {\npublic:\n\n    Scene(std::vector<GameObject> newGameObjects){\n        gameObjects = newGameObjects;\n    }\n\n    std::vector<GameObject> getValidGameObjects() {\n        std::vector<GameObject> activeGameObjects;\n        for (auto gameObject : gameObjects) {\n            if (isValid(gameObject)) {\n                activeGameObjects.push_back(gameObject);\n            }\n        }\n        return activeGameObjects;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n\n    std::vector<GameObject> gameObjects;\n\n    bool isValid(GameObject gameObject) {\n        return gameObject.isActive && isValid(gameObject.mesh);\n    }\n\n    bool isValid(std::vector<Point> mesh) {\n        return mesh.size() > 0;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nWhoah!! I mean, the code now seems self explained. Each instruction appears more clear in its intents. Each class,\nstruct and method doesn't need any additional comment/documentation. I think it's really amazing how some changes to the\nnames could improve the quality of a piece of code dramatically like in our case. We're done with names :relieved:. You\ncan find the complete\nexample [here](https://github.com/chicio/Clean-Code-Meaningful-Names \"Renaming clean code example\")\nI hope that this article will convince you that the names you choose define how much you code is \"beautiful\" in terms of\nreadability and also, more import, maintainability. Quoting\nwhat [Grady Booch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch \"Grady Booch\") said about clean code:\n\n> Clean Code reads like a well-written prose.\n\nChoosing the right names is the first step to make your code more similar to a well-written prose.\n","slug":"/2017/09/11/clean-code-meaningful-names/","description":"In this post I will talk about clean code and how important are the name you choose while you're developing software.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"e2ff53cf-a040-5e4c-9843-0340716b6a03":{"title":"Mp3ID3Tagger: a native macOS app to edit the ID3 tag of your mp3 files written using RxSwift and RxCocoa","content":"\n*The third of a short series of post in which I describe my two latest project: ID3TagEditor and Mp3ID3Tagger. In this\npost I will talk about Mp3ID3Tagger, a macOS application to edit id3 tag of your mp3 files.*\n\n---\n\nIn [this previous post](/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/ \"born id3tageditor mp3id3tagger\") I described\nthe reason why I develop [Mp3ID3Tagger](https://github.com/chicio/Mp3ID3Tagger \"mp3 id3 tag editor macos\"), a macOS app\nto edit the id3 tag of your mp3 files that leverage on the power\nof [ID3TagEditor](/2018/05/08/id3tageditor-swift-read-write-id3-tag-mp3/). Below you can find the app logo.\n\n![The MP3ID3Tagger logo](../images/posts/mp3id3tagger-logo.jpg)\n\nSo how did I develop MP3ID3Tagger? I was about to start the development following the classic approach to develop an app\non every Apple\nOS: [Model View Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller \"Model View Controller\")\nand plain Swift. But then I though: \"This is the perfect project to test one of the last programming technique I\nrecently learned: Reactive Programming/Reactive Extensions with RxSwift and RxCocoa!!!!!! In this way I can also try to\nuse a different architectural pattern:\nthe [Model View ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel \"Model View ViewModel\")\" :\nsunglasses:.What kind of architectural pattern is the MVVM? What are Reactive Programming, Reactive Extensions, RxSwift\nand RxCocoa???  \nLet's start from the first one. The MVVM is an architectural pattern invented by the Microsoft software engineers Ken\nCooper and Ted Peters. As for other architecture\npatterns [I described in the past](/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/ \"Model View Presenter\")\n, the MVVM is useful to clearly separate the UI development from the business logic. The main components of the MVVM\nare:\n\n* the *Model*, that usually represents the business logic of the application.\n* the *View*, as in the other architectural pattern, the view is the structure, layout, and appearance of what a user\n  sees on the screen.\n* the *View model*, that usually represents an abstraction of the view exposing public properties and commands.\n* the *Binder* interprets bindings defined in the View, observes the View Model for changes in state and updates the\n  View and finally observes the View for changes in state and updates the View Model.\n\nFrom the definition above we see that the MVVM needs something to bind the view to the view model in a platform\nindependent way. This is why we need [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift \"RxSWift\")\n, [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxCocoa \"RxCocoa\")\nand [Reactive Extensions (usually called ReactiveX)](http://reactivex.io/ \"Rx\"). What are they? Let's see some quote for\nthe definitions:\n\n> Reactive Extensions (also known as ReactiveX or Rx) is a set of tools allowing imperative programming languages to operate on sequences of data regardless of whether the data is synchronous or asynchronous. It provides a set of sequence operators that operate on each item in the sequence...ReactiveX is API for asynchronous programming with observable streams...RxSwift is the Swift version of ReactiveX (Rx)...RxCocoa is a framework that helps make Cocoa APIs used in iOS and OS X easier to use with reactive techniques...\n\nThe main components of RxSwift are:\n\n* `Observables`, that are something which emit notifications of change, and `Observers`, that are something which\n  subscribe to an Observable, in order to be notified when it has changed\n* `Subjects`, that are entity that act both as an `Observable` and as an `Observer`\n* `Operator`, that are basically functions that work on `Observable` and return `Observable`\n\nSo RxSwift and RxCocoa let us create an abstraction from the platform specific UI implementation and let us implement\nour ViewModel by working in an event-driven way: the ViewModel only works with streams of data that comes\nfrom `Observable` and `Subjects` of RxSwift. RxCocoa gives us an abstraction over Cocoa and Cocoa Touch specific\ncomponents and let us work with generic observable UI component. This basically means that:\n\n* RxSwift and RxCocoa are our Binder of the MVVM\n* the Various View and View Controllers are the View of the MVVM\n* the ID3TagEditor will be the Model of the MVVM\n* the ViewModel will connect the View and the ID3TagEditor Model in a platform UI independent way\n\nWith this architecture we can also think about using the same Model and ViewModel on different platform. So if in the\nfuture I will develop an iOS version of Mp3ID3Tagger, I will only have to develop the View part. So let's start to see\nhow I implemented Mp3ID3Tagger, the app subject of this post. Let's start from the UI to see how MP3ID3Tagger does look\nlike. The app has only one screen where the user can input its the data he/she want to insert into the tag. There is a\nbutton on the left to select the cover and all the textual/numeric values on the left. The values that could be set from\na list are implemented as `NSPopUpButton` components.\n\n![The MP3ID3Tagger interface](../images/posts/mp3id3tagger-interface.jpg)\n\nThe first building block is the `ViewModel` base class. This class is useful to centralize the setup of a `disposeBag`.\nThe `DisposeBag` it’s an RxSwift component that keeps a reference to all the `Disposable` you add to it.\nThe `Observable` are `Disposable`, so you can add them to it to have an ARC-like behaviour: when the `DisposeBag` will\nbe released all the `Disposable`  instances it keeps will be released as well. So by having the `ViewModel` base class\nall the ViewModel will have a `disposeBag` by default where they will add their disposables. As we have seen before the\napp just one screen, so there's just one `ViewModel` subclass to represent that screen, the `Mp3ID3TaggerViewModel`\nclass. This class has 4 properties:\n\n* `id3TagReader`, of type `ID3TagReader`. This class has the responsibility to read a tag from an mp3 file when\n  an `openAction` occurs. So `ID3TagReader` will be a subscriber of the `openAction` observable.\n* `id3TagWriter`, of type `ID3TagWriter`. This class has the responsibility to save a new tag to the mp3 file currently\n  opened (the last `openAction` value) when a `saveAction` occurs. So `ID3TagWriter` will be a subscriber of\n  the `saveAction` observable.\n* `form`, of type `Form`. This class has the responsibility to fill the fields of the form on the UI with values of the\n  ID3tag read by the `id3TagReader` when an mp3 file has been opened. It has also the responsibility to collect the data\n  contained in the form so that the `id3TagWriter` can write them when a `saveAction` occurs.\n* `saveResult`, of type `PublishSubject<Bool>`. This subject publishes the result of a save action made by\n  the `id3TagWriter`.\n\n```swift\nclass Mp3ID3TaggerViewModel: ViewModel {\n    let id3TagReader: ID3TagReader\n    let id3TagWriter: ID3TagWriter\n    let form: Form\n    let saveResult: PublishSubject<Bool>\n\n    init(openAction: Observable<String>, saveAction: Observable<Void>) {\n        self.id3TagReader = ID3TagReader(id3TagEditor: ID3TagEditor(), openAction: openAction)\n        self.id3TagWriter = ID3TagWriter(id3TagEditor: ID3TagEditor(), saveAction: saveAction)\n        self.form = Form()\n        self.saveResult = PublishSubject<Bool>()\n        super.init()\n\n        id3TagReader.read { [unowned self] id3Tag in\n            self.form.fillFields(using: id3Tag)\n        }\n\n        id3TagWriter.write(input: Observable.combineLatest(form.readFields(), openAction)) { result in\n            self.saveResult.onNext(result)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow we can see the details of all these collaborators of our view model. Let's start from the `ID3TagReader`. This class\nkeeps a reference to an instance of the `ID3TagEditor`. Its main function is `read(_ finish: @escaping (ID3Tag?) -> ()`.\nIn this function there is the subscribe to the `openAction` observable received at construction time (passed by\nthe `Mp3ID3TaggerViewModel`). Each new value received from the `openAction` is a path to a new mp3 file. This path is\npassed to the `ID3TagEditor` instance that read of the ID3 tag of the song. If everything goes well, the tag is returned\nto the caller by using the `finish` closure. If you remember the `Mp3ID3TaggerViewModel` class, in this `finish` closure\nthe `form` class is called that execute the fill of the fields (we will see below how it does this operation).\n\n```swift\nclass ID3TagReader {\n    private let id3TagEditor: ID3TagEditor\n    private let openAction: Observable<String>\n    private let disposeBag: DisposeBag\n\n    init(id3TagEditor: ID3TagEditor, openAction: Observable<String>) {\n        self.id3TagEditor = id3TagEditor\n        self.openAction = openAction\n        self.disposeBag = DisposeBag()\n    }\n\n    func read(_ finish: @escaping (ID3Tag?) -> ()) {\n        openAction.subscribe(onNext: { [unowned self] path in\n            do {\n                let id3Tag = try self.id3TagEditor.read(from: path)\n                finish(id3Tag)\n            } catch {\n                finish(nil)\n            }\n        }).disposed(by: disposeBag)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen we have the `ID3TagWriter` class. Like the `ID3TagReader`, this class keeps a reference to an instance of\nthe `ID3TagEditor`. Its main function is `write(input: Observable<(ID3Tag, String)>, _ finish: @escaping (Bool) -> ())`.\nThis function takes two parameters:\n\n* `input` of type `Observable<(ID3Tag, String)>`. This is an observable on a tuple composed by the path of an mp3 file\n  and an ID3 tag\n* `finish` of type `(Bool) -> ()`\n\nInside this function there's the subscription to the `saveAction` observable received at construction time from\nthe `Mp3ID3TaggerViewModel` class. This observable is combined with the `input` observable received as parameter and\ndescribed above and a new subscription to the result of the combination is created: each time we receive a path to an\nmp3 file, an ID3 tag and a save action is triggered the `ID3TagEditor` instance is used to write the ID3 tag to the mp3\nfile. The called of the `write` function of the `ID3TagWriter` is notified of the result of the operation by calling\nthe `finish` operation.\n\n```swift\nclass ID3TagWriter {\n    private let id3TagEditor: ID3TagEditor\n    private let saveAction: Observable<Void>\n    private let disposeBag: DisposeBag\n\n    init(id3TagEditor: ID3TagEditor, saveAction: Observable<Void>) {\n        self.id3TagEditor = id3TagEditor\n        self.saveAction = saveAction\n        self.disposeBag = DisposeBag()\n    }\n\n    func write(input: Observable<(ID3Tag, String)>, _ finish: @escaping (Bool) -> ()) {\n        saveAction\n            .withLatestFrom(input)\n            .subscribe(onNext: { [unowned self] event in\n                do {\n                    try self.id3TagEditor.write(tag: event.0, to: event.1)\n                    finish(true)\n                } catch {\n                    finish(false)\n                }\n            })\n            .disposed(by: disposeBag)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow let's see the `Form` class and its collaborators. This class has 5 collaborators. Each collaborator represents a\nsubset of the form fields. This fields are represented as `Variable` subject of the specific type of the fields. In this\nway we are able to publish new values (by using the `value` property) to this observable and at the same time observe\ntheir values. In fact in this class there are two functions:\n\n* `readFields()`, that creates an observable from the fields observables by combining them using the Rx\n  operator `combineLatest`\n* `fillFields(using id3Tag: ID3Tag?)`, that sets the value of the fields observables with the received id3 tag (read by\n  the ID3TagReader when an mp3 file has been opened)\n\nBelow you can find the `Form` class with all the implementations also for its collaborators. In this way it's easy to\nnote what I stated above: the set of all the `Variable` fields of this classes matches the set of the UI components that\nwe saw in the screenshot of the app that you saw above. One last important thing to note: the\nclass `AttachedPictureField` forces the type of the attached picture to be saved to `FrontCover`\n. [In this way the ID3TagEditor will write the ID3 tag with the correct data to display the album cover on my renault clio](/2018/05/07/born-id3tageditor-mp3id3tagger/ \"mp3id3tagger id3tageditor\")!!!

controller of the app that basically corresponds to the View of the MVVM. Its name\nis `Mp3ID3TaggerViewController`. This controller will implement a protocol I defined: the `BindableView` protocol. This\nprotocol represents the View part in the MVVM architecture. This protocol must be implemented only by subclasses of\nthe `NSViewController`. The protocol contains a property and a function. The `viewModel` forces the class (the View) to\nhave a property that represents its ViewModel. The function `bindViewModel` is where the View and the View model are\nbound together. The `bindViewModel` must be called inside one the lifecycle methods of the `NSViewController`.\n\n```swift\nprotocol BindableView where Self: NSViewController {\n    associatedtype ViewModelType\n    var viewModel: ViewModelType! { get set }\n    func bindViewModel()\n}\n```\n\nIf we look at the implementation of the `bindViewModel` method, we can see where something \"magical\" is happening :\ncrystal_ball:: an instance of `Mp3ID3TaggerViewModel` class is created and the UI components that represents the various\nfield of the form are bounded to the view model fields by using the custom operator `<->`. So this operator let us\ndefine the what is called **two way binding** or **bidirectional binding** using RxSwift:\n\n* each `Variable` field of the view model is bounded to a field on the UI. This basically means that each value we set a\n  in the `value` property of a `Variable` field will be displayed on the UI Cocoa specific field.\n\n* each value inserted in the UI Cocoa specific field will be set in the corresponding `Variable` field on the view\n  model.\n\nIn this way the View Model is completely decoupled from the View part (in this case the `NSViewController`).

In this post we will talk about camera and rendering. Let's start from camera.  \nIf we select a camera, we can access its properties from the specific camera tab in the properties panel. Here we have a\nsection called \"Display\", that let us customize how we see the camera in the viewport (limits, names and so on). Then we\nhave a \"Lens\" section, where we can choose the type of the camera:\n\n* orthogonal\n* perspective\n* panoramic\n\nFor the perspective camera we can change:\n\n* the focal length\n* the shift, so as the word say we can change the shift of the camera from its center\n* the clipping, the start end distance between which the object see by the camera will be rendered.\n\nFor the orthographic camera the most important parameter is the orthographic scale, that represent the maximum\ndimension (in scene units) of the portion of space captured from the camera.\n\n![Camera options](../images/posts/blender-camera-options.jpg)\n\nWe can place cameras manually or we can use constraints. We can create a constraint by clicking the specific constraint\ntab (the one with the chain as icon) in the properties panel of the camera and add a new constraint. We can use for\nexample a Damped Track and correlate the movement of our camera to the position of an object we select as the one to be\ntracked.\n\n![Camera constraints](../images/posts/blender-camera-constraints.jpg)\n\nFor what concerns rendering, we have the possibility to control it in the properties panel under the render tab (the one\nwith the camera). For example we can customize where the render will happen. By default the render will show the result\nin the image editor, but we can change it by selecting one of the available option in the list. We can change the\ndimensions of the render result in terms of width/height but also in terms of FPS. We will see why this parameter is\nimportant in a future post about **animations**. We can also customize the algorithm used for anti aliasing. Very\nimportant, we can also customize the shading option (as we already see in a previous post about shadows), the\nperformance (for example by adjusting the number of thread that Blender will be allowed to use), and the format of final\noutput of the rendering.\n\n![Rendering option](../images/posts/blender-render-option.jpg)\n\nAs we said before in Blender it is possible to render animation. We will go through all the details about animation in a\nfuture post. For now we can see how to achieve cool rendering effects, for example motion blur. The motion blur is an\neffect you have when an object is moving in the length of the exposure of the camera. We can achieve this effect by\nactivating it in the rendering properties and setting the number of motion sample we want. We can also modify the\nshutter to change the final result of the motion blur (the default value for samples is 1, and we need to modify it\nbecause with the value of 1 we will have no motion blur).\n\n![Add motion blur](../images/posts/blender-motion-blur.jpg)\n\nOne last effect we can achieve with the Blender render is depth of field. This effect simulate the fact that only a part\nof the scene is in focus, based on the focal distance from the camera. To setup the depth of field in our scene, first\nof all we have to activate it by increasing the distance option in the depth of field section of the camera properties.\n\n![Add blender depth of field](../images/posts/blender-depth-of-field-1.jpg)\n\nAfter that we have to switch to the node editor, add a defocus filter, and connect the render image and depth to the\nfilter, and again the image to the composite final result.\n\n![Activate the node editor](../images/posts/blender-depth-of-field-2.jpg)\n\n![Select the blur filter](../images/posts/blender-depth-of-field-3.jpg)\n\n![Setup defocus](../images/posts/blender-depth-of-field-4.jpg)\n\n![The depth of field final result](../images/posts/blender-depth-of-field-5.jpg)\n\nThat's all for camera and rendering.

The purpose of this operation is to make the code easier to read, thus to change without introducing\nerrors. We will also get for free a structure that will be able to apply a more generic set of rules than the one\ndefined at the beginning.  \nThe code of this post is based on a piece of code used to satisfy a real business need, we just removed the business\nrelated details. The language used is java.\n\n#### The process in short\n\n* Flatten the if structure into a flat sequence of `if` clauses\n* Extract each condition and the related action into a single class\n* Create a common interface for all the extracted conditions\n* Put all the conditions into a list\n* Loop over the list and return the first action for which the condition is satisfied\n\n#### The need\n\nIt seemed a normal day of work when one of our managers called a meeting to inform us of a very urgent feature that\nshould be put in production within 2 days. So, as it usually happens in this case, between the deriving chaos and the\ntons of alignment meetings that continuously interrupted us, we produced a code that basically \"worked\", but it was a\nbit chaotic. Luckily we were able at least to write the tests. So, once we put in production the feature, we decided to\nimmediately refactor the piece of code.\n\n#### The process\n\nWe are going to see a step by step refactor of a specific class that transforms the if-nested structure into a chain of\nresponsibility. We are not going to change the tests because they work as an acceptance test for our use case. In an\nideal world, with a lot of time available, we would also write the tests of all the classes we are going to extract and\nsimplify the current test. But, you know, we are not in an ideal world 😅.  \nThe idea behind this refactor is to proceed with small steps, possibly using the IDE functionality (I used IDEA which is\nvery good at it), and run the tests after every operation. Also, after each step there is a commit, not only to allow\neveryone to follow the evolution of the code through the commits, but also to allow us to simply\nuse ```git checkout .``` in case of errors, in order to come back to the previous working version. All of this, allows\nus to keep the code strictly under control and avoid to introduce bugs during the refactoring. I will use the diff\nsyntax to show the differences between some pieces of code. Please keep in mind that I will use it in order to\nhighlight *only the main differences* between one commit and the other and it won't be the exact diff you can get with\ngit.\n\n#### The initial code\n\nHere you can find the code we were not very proud of. In particular, I report the nested if structure, which is the part\nwe are going to\nrefactor. ([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/a6681dd088d06244878e0527e87b4c6b5bbfd50d/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```java\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, TranslationRepository translationRepository, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n        if (flight.isOneWay()) {\n            if (isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                LocalDateTime flightOutboundDate = flight.getFirstLeg().getFirstHop().getDeparture().getDate();\n                if (flightOutboundDate.isAfter(LocalDateTime.of(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0))) {\n                    return newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                } else {\n                    return oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationInfo(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                }\n            } else {\n                return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n            }\n        } else { //round trip\n            if (isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                LocalDateTime outboundDepartureDate = order.getOutboundDepartureDate();\n                LocalDate returnDepartureDate = order.getReturnDepartureDate();\n                if (outboundDepartureDate.isAfter(LocalDateTime.of(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0))\n                        || returnDepartureDate.isAfter(LocalDate.of(2018, 10, 31))) {\n                    return newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                } else {\n                    return oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationInfo(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                }\n            } else {\n                return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### The execution\n\n##### 1. Flatten the if structure\n\nThe idea here is to transform the nested if structure into a flat sequence of `if` clauses in order to isolate and\nexplicit each single condition.  \nTo do so with very small steps, we are going to remove the `else` part of each `if` clause, by transforming such part\ninto an `if` clause whose condition is the negation of the original one. In the following piece of code, you can notice\nhow the outer if-else has become a couple of `if` clauses, one for the original condition `flight.isOneWay()` and the\nother one with the opposite condition `!flight.isOneWay()`\n. ([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/a49340d05153074158cc59c130de6875276a92ab/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, TranslationRepository translationRepository, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n        if (flight.isOneWay()) {\n            if (isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                LocalDateTime flightOutboundDate = flight.getFirstLeg().getFirstHop().getDeparture().getDate();\n                if (flightOutboundDate.isAfter(LocalDateTime.of(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0))) {\n                    return newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                } else {\n                    return oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationInfo(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                }\n            } else {\n                return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n            }\n        }\n-       else {\n+       if (!flight.isOneWay()) {  //round trip\n            if (isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                LocalDateTime outboundDepartureDate = order.getOutboundDepartureDate();\n                LocalDate returnDepartureDate = order.getReturnDepartureDate();\n                if (outboundDepartureDate.isAfter(LocalDateTime.of(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0))\n                        || returnDepartureDate.isAfter(LocalDate.of(2018, 10, 31))) {\n                    return newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                } else {\n                    return oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationInfo(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                }\n            } else {\n                return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n            }\n        }\n\n        return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnce done this, we are going to proceed with the inner `if-else` conditions, which is `isMyCompany(flight)`.\n([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/193aab6e25e83ba9c453b87961fb1582b0a63828/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, TranslationRepository translationRepository, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n        if (flight.isOneWay()) {\n            if (isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                LocalDateTime flightOutboundDate = flight.getFirstLeg().getFirstHop().getDeparture().getDate();\n                if (flightOutboundDate.isAfter(LocalDateTime.of(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0))) {\n                    return newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                } else {\n                    return oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationInfo(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                }\n            }\n-           else {\n+           if (!isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (!flight.isOneWay()) {  //round trip\n            if (isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                LocalDateTime outboundDepartureDate = order.getOutboundDepartureDate();\n                LocalDate returnDepartureDate = order.getReturnDepartureDate();\n                if (outboundDepartureDate.isAfter(LocalDateTime.of(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0))\n                        || returnDepartureDate.isAfter(LocalDate.of(2018, 10, 31))) {\n                    return newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                } else {\n                    return oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationInfo(translationRepository, renderLanguage);\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (!isMyCompany(flight)) {\n                return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n            }\n        }\n\n        return noMyCompanyInformationInfo();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe proceed in this way until we have removed all the `else` conditions from the code.

In order to reduce the responsibilities of the `HandBaggageInformationFactory`, here, we are going\nto extract three factories, each one responsible for creating a specific `HandBaggageInformation`. Without diving into\nthe code used to create the object, we just extract the `NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory` out of the\nmethod `newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformation`\n. ([Step 1](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/5419c7d777f7562f89c65d55a83181b787a7c9eb/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java)\n, [Step 2](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/3b6651b149932befca35c40a02c4bbd79cfab8d9/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java)\nand [Step 3](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/ed33c4490bccfc828391516c12561b83d0428000/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\nIf you are using IDEA, an easy way is to do it is to use its `Extract method object` feature. I won't explain how to do\nit here, because it is out of the scope of this topic, but I have just realized I have found the next topic of my blog (\nthis is great! isn't it? :smirk:).\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, TranslationRepository translationRepository, String renderLanguage, Integer

we repeat the operation for the other two methods that create the objects, obtaining\nthe `NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory` and the `OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory`.\n([Source

default\nvalue, `notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory` method `make()`. First of all, we remove the condition that once true uses the default behaviour (`!flight.isOneWay() && !isMyCompany(flight)`), because it is redundant. Then, for each remaining\ncondition we create a class containing the evaluation of the condition and the related action.  \nI skip this step by step diff because it is a repetition of the previous one, but in the repo there are all the commits\nthat show the process. The resulting code, after having extracted all the conditions, is the\nfollowing.

Create a common signature to extract the chain item\n\nThe purpose here is to obtain a common signature for all the conditions we have just extracted. As this part is more\ndomain oriented, I am not diving into the details. Just notice the three main modifications:\n\n* the `Order` has the same information as the `Flight` for our case, so we remove the `Order` class in favor of\n  the `Flight` class.\n* Keep only one date, which is our threshold date, by playing a bit with `isAfter()` and `isBefore()`.\n* Move some operations from the `HandBaggageInformationFactory` class to the `Flight` one, which is more domain\n  oriented.

it's time to extract each policy into its own file and move all the policies into a package, that, for the sake of\ngiving meaningful names, we call `policy`. To do this, we need to duplicate our threshold constant into more than one\npolicy implementation. This could be arguable as it is a duplication. Of course, there are alternatives to this, like\nmaking the constant public, but then we have the problem to decide where to put it.  \nSo, given the nature of our real case problem, in which the date will pass soon, and its very urgent time to market, we\ndecide to apply the ostrich algorithm (i.e. we are ignore this discussion) and prefer duplication over other solutions\n🙈🙉🙊.\n\nAlso we move the creation of all the policies before the evaluation, for a reason you will understand in the next step.\n([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/66da72572de64865537c8baf8f24499ee6b841b7/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, TranslationRepository translationRepository, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n\n        NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n                new NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory(translationRepository);\n        OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n                new OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory(translationRepository);\n        NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n                new NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory();\n\n        MyCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n                new MyCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+       MyCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember =\n+               new MyCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+       MyCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n+               new MyCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+       MyCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember = new\n+               MyCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n\n        if (myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember.canHandle(flight)) {\n            return myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember.getFrom(renderLanguage);\n        }\n\n-       MyCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember =\n-               new MyCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n        if (myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember.canHandle(flight)) {\n            return myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember.getFrom(renderLanguage);\n        }\n\n-       MyCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n-               new MyCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n        if (myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember.canHandle(flight)) {\n            return myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember\n                    .getFrom(renderLanguage);\n        }\n\n-       MyCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember = new\n-               MyCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n        if (myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember.canHandle(flight)) {\n            return myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember.getFrom(renderLanguage);\n        }\n\n        return notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory.make();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### 5. Inject the chain at construction time\n\nNow that we have all the policies created at the same point of our code, we can put all of them inside a list, loop over\nthe list and just apply the first policy satisfying the condition. In this way, we remove the chain of `if` in favor of\na chain of\nresponsibility.

I know, it's getting kind of repetitive 😅 but this is one of the refactoring commands we use most frequently\nwhen we refactor code, so using it makes you save a lot of\ntime.([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/0255c3442abd34a07832a367ca0ee04bfc624659/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, TranslationRepository translationRepository, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n\n-       NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n-               new NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory(translationRepository);\n-       OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n-               new OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory(translationRepository);\n        NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n               new NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory();\n\n-       HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n-               new MyCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n-       HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember =\n-               new MyCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n-       HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n-               new MyCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n-       HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember = new\n-               MyCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n-\n-       List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> policies = Arrays.asList(\n-               myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember,\n-               myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember,\n-               myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember,\n-               myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember\n-       );\n\n+       List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> policies = new HandBaggagePoliciesFactory().make(translationRepository);\n\n        return policies.stream()\n                .filter(policy -> policy.canHandle(flight))\n                .findFirst()\n                .map(policy -> policy.getFrom(renderLanguage))\n                .orElse(notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory.make());\n    }\n\n+   private static class HandBaggagePoliciesFactory {\n+       public List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> make(TranslationRepository translationRepository) {\n+           NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n+                   new NewMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory(translationRepository);\n+           OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n+                   new OldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory(translationRepository);\n+\n+           HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n+                   new MyCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+           HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember =\n+                   new MyCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+           HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember =\n+                   new MyCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember(newMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+           HandBaggageInformationPolicy myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember = new\n+                   MyCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember(oldMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory);\n+\n+           return Arrays.asList(\n+                   myCompanyOneWayAfterTheFirstOfNovember,\n+                   myCompanyOneWayBeforeTheFirstOfNovember,\n+                   myCompanyRoundTripAtLeastOneDepartureAfterTheFirstOfNovember,\n+                   myCompanyRoundTripAllDeparturesBeforeTheFirstOfNovember\n+           );\n+       }\n+   }\n}\n```\n\nAnd after extracting the class `HandBaggagePoliciesFactory` in its own file, we are going to inject the policies as\nparameter at construction time of `HandBaggageInformationFactory`. In case of Idea, you can make the IDE work for you.\nYou can just make the `policies` variable of `from` method become a field, with the command `Extract field`, decide to\ndefine it in the constructor and, then, simply use the `Extract parameter` feature in order to update all the\nconstructors of your object.\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n\n+   private final List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> handBaggageInformationPolicies;\n\n+   public HandBaggageInformationFactory(List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> handBaggageInformationPolicies) {\n+       this.handBaggageInformationPolicies = handBaggageInformationPolicies;\n+   }\n\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n\n        NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n                new NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory();\n\n-       List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> policies = new HandBaggagePoliciesFactory().make(translationRepository);\n\n        return handBaggageInformationPolicies.stream()\n                .filter(policy -> policy.canHandle(flight))\n                .findFirst()\n                .map(policy -> policy.getFrom(renderLanguage))\n                .orElse(notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory.make());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nIn our example, only the `HandBaggageInformationFactoryTest` has been updated. Notice, though, that we don't need to\nperform changes on the tests at all. They still\npass. ([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/99d743baa3d65c8041cb09af6dde757408914272/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactoryTest {\n\n    private HandBaggageInformationFactory handBaggageInformationFactory;\n\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() {\n        TranslationRepository translationRepository = Mockito.mock(TranslationRepository.class);\n-        handBaggageInformationFactory = new HandBaggageInformationFactory();\n+        handBaggageInformationFactory =\n+                new HandBaggageInformationFactory(HandBaggagePoliciesFactory.make(translationRepository));\n+        }\n\n    //The rest is the same\n}\n```\n\nIn order to maintain the same level of abstraction, we are going to inject also\nthe `NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory` into the `HandBaggageInformationFactory`.\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactory {\n\n    private final List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> handBaggageInformationPolicies;\n+   private final NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory fallbackHandBaggageFactory;\n\n-   public HandBaggageInformationFactory(List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> handBaggageInformationPolicies) {\n+   public HandBaggageInformationFactory(List<HandBaggageInformationPolicy> handBaggageInformationPolicies,\n+                                        NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory fallbackHandBaggageFactory) {\n        this.handBaggageInformationPolicies = handBaggageInformationPolicies;\n+       this.fallbackHandBaggageFactory = fallbackHandBaggageFactory;\n+   }\n\n    public HandBaggageInformation from(Order order, String renderLanguage, Integer flightId) {\n        Flight flight = order.findFlight(flightId);\n\n-       NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory notMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory =\n-                       new NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory();\n\n        return handBaggageInformationPolicies.stream()\n                .filter(policy -> policy.canHandle(flight))\n                .findFirst()\n                .map(policy -> policy.getFrom(renderLanguage))\n                .orElse(fallbackHandBaggageFactory.make());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd, then, again, the `HandBaggageInformationFactoryTest` gets\nupdated. ([Source code](https://github.com/bonfa/IfRemovingARealUseCase/blob/eac1ba3e1dc8f5cce3ba6c545349cd6d4730671e/src/main/java/it/fbonfadelli/hand_baggage/HandBaggageInformationFactory.java))\n\n```diff\npublic class HandBaggageInformationFactoryTest {\n\n private HandBaggageInformationFactory handBaggageInformationFactory;\n\n     @Before\n     public void setUp() {\n         TranslationRepository translationRepository = Mockito.mock(TranslationRepository.class);\n         handBaggageInformationFactory =\n            new HandBaggageInformationFactory(\n                HandBaggagePoliciesFactory.make(translationRepository),\n+                    new NotMyCompanyHandBaggageInformationFactory()\n            );\n\n     //The rest is the same\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd, that's it. You could keep on working on this piece of code to improve it more and more. But for post, we reached\nour goal, so no more refactoring 👏.\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nIn this article we saw how to transform, step by step, a nested if structure into a chain of responsibility. The purpose\nof it is to make the code more readable and though easier to extend without introducing bugs. The main steps are flatten\nthe if structure into a sequence of plain if clauses, extract each if clause and its correspondent effect into a\nseparate class, extract an interface which is common to all the extracted classes, create an array containing all the\nclasses, loop over it by using the first item of the list that is able to handle the case you are dealing with, inject\nthe list of classes in order to make the class work with any combination of rules that you want. Additionally, we saw\nsome features of Idea IDE that allow us to perform most of the refactoring operations automatically, with only a few\nshortcuts.\n","slug":"/2018/09/18/refactoring-if-chain-of-responsibility/","description":"In this post my colleague Francesco Bonfadelli will show you how to transform a nested if structure into a chain of responsibility.","authors":["francesco-bonfadelli"]},"ed7d9c5a-1c2e-53cc-8ce6-3b638eaa3a7f":{"title":"Asynchronous testing in Swift","content":"\n*In this post I will talk about asynchronous testing in Swift.*\n\n---\n\nAs we saw in [this post](/2017/06/02/swift-closure-syntax/ \"what are closure\") and also\nin [this other one](/2017/06/14/swift-closure-demystifying-autoclosure-escaping/ \"autoclose and escaping\"), closures\nare one of the most important building block of Swift. They are extensively used inside the iOS SDK.  \nBut in the previous posts about closures I didn't answer one very important question: how can you do unit test\nasynchronous operation and closure? It seems Apple has the answer for us!! Inside the iOS Testing framework we have **\nexpectations**.\n\n![Yes, you can test asynchronous code!](../images/posts/expectation-closure.jpg)\n\nHow do they work? To test that asynchronous operations (and closure) behave as expected, you create one or more\nexpectations within your test, and then fulfill those expectations when the asynchronous operation completes\nsuccessfully. Your test method waits until all expectations are fulfilled or a specified timeout expires. The general\ncode structure for expectation with closure is like the following example:\n\n```swift\nlet expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: \"Expectation description\")\n\nyourInstance.method(param: \"aParam\") {\n    <Your assert using XCTAssert...>\n    expectation.fulfill()\n}\n\nwait(for: [expectation], timeout: <time to wait the fulfillment of the expecation>)\n```\n\nBasically to test asynchronous operation/closure you must:\n\n* create an expectation that is an instance of `XCTestExpectation`\n* execute your closure, make your assert on the closure return value/parameter and call the method `fulfill`\n  of `XCTestExpectation`\n\nSo, what about a more complex example? Let's see how powerful expectation are and most importantly how we can test them.\nSuppose for example we have a [use case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case \"use case\") class\ncalled `PasswordUpdateUseCase` with the following implementation:\n\n```swift\npublic class PasswordUpdateUseCase {\n    private let passwordService: PasswordService\n    private let passwordRepository: PasswordRepository\n\n    public init(passwordService: PasswordService, passwordRepository: PasswordRepository) {\n        self.passwordService = passwordService\n        self.passwordRepository = passwordRepository\n    }\n\n    public func update(password: String) {\n        passwordService.update(password: password) { success, error in\n            if success {\n                self.passwordRepository.save(password: password)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see inside the `update` method we have an instance of `PasswordService` that, as the method name suggest,\nexecute an update of the user password and return the result of the operation inside a closure. How do we unit test?\nLet's see how we can achieve our objective using some handmade mock and expectation. For this post I will **NOT USE**\nthe  [\"Given-then-when\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given-When-Then \"Given-then-when\") structure I used in\na [previous post](/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/), because I want to keep the\nfocus on the code structure. First of all, to test our use case we need to mock the `PasswordRepository`. In our test we\nwant to verify if our `save` method has been called or not. We can achieve this objective by implementing a spy\nobject, `PasswordDatabaseRepositorySpy`, that exposes a status property `savePasswordHasBeenCalled`.\n\n```swift\nclass PasswordDatabaseRepositorySpy: PasswordRepository {\n    private(set) var savePasswordHasBeenCalled = false\n\n    func save(password: String) {\n        savePasswordHasBeenCalled = true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow it's time to mock our `PasswordService`. We need to mock it so that it has the following features:\n\n* it exposes a status property that let us know if the method `update` has been called\n* it simulates an asynchronous call inside the `update` method\n* it can fulfill the expectation of our test in time\n\nA lot of stuff to do. Let's see how we can implement it. We will call it `PasswordNetworkServiceSpy`.\n\n```swift\nclass PasswordNetworkServiceSpy: PasswordService {\n    private(set) var updatePasswordHasBeenCalled = false\n    private let expectation: XCTestExpectation\n    private let successful: Bool\n\n    init(expectation: XCTestExpectation, successful: Bool) {\n        self.expectation = expectation\n        self.successful = successful\n    }\n\n    func update(password: String, completion: @escaping (Bool, Error) -> ()) {\n        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + .milliseconds(200)) {\n            self.updatePasswordHasBeenCalled = true\n            completion(self.successful, NSError(domain: \"error\", code: -1, userInfo: nil))\n            self.expectation.fulfill()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe interesting thing of our implementation is that our spy will be in charge of fulfill the expectation, because the\nclosure executed inside the `PasswordUpdateUseCase` is created inside our `PasswordService` spy, and we have to be sure\nthat after its execution the `expectation.fulfill()` is called.  \nNow we are ready to write our unit tests. We will test two cases: update successful and update failure.\n\n```swift\nclass AsynchronousTestingClosureDependencyTests: XCTestCase {\n\n    func testUseCaseUpdatePasswordSuccessful() {\n        let updateExpectation = expectation(description: \"updateExpectation\")\n        let service = PasswordNetworkServiceSpy(expectation: updateExpectation, successful: true)\n        let repository = PasswordDatabaseRepositorySpy()\n        let passwordUseCase = PasswordUpdateUseCase(passwordService: service,\n                                                    passwordRepository: repository)\n        passwordUseCase.update(password: \"::password::\")\n        wait(for: [updateExpectation], timeout: 300)\n        XCTAssertTrue(service.updatePasswordHasBeenCalled)\n        XCTAssertTrue(repository.savePasswordHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n\n    func testUseCaseUpdatePasswordFail() {\n        let updateExpectation = expectation(description: \"updateExpectation\")\n        let service = PasswordNetworkServiceSpy(expectation: updateExpectation, successful: false)\n        let repository = PasswordDatabaseRepositorySpy()\n        let passwordUseCase = PasswordUpdateUseCase(passwordService: service,\n                                                    passwordRepository: repository)\n        passwordUseCase.update(password: \"::password::\")\n        wait(for: [updateExpectation], timeout: 300)\n        XCTAssertTrue(service.updatePasswordHasBeenCalled)\n        XCTAssertFalse(repository.savePasswordHasBeenCalled)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see in this test we have an example of an expectation creation/usage. In each test we are calling\nthe `wait(for: [updateExpectation], timeout: 300)` so that the tests will \"wait\" until the expectation is fulfilled or\nthe max timeout is reach (and in the last case the test fails, no matter the other condition). The most strange thing is\nrelated to the order of instruction between the `wait` and the various `XCTAssert`. To make our tests work we need to\nwait until the closure inside the `update` method of the use case is completed. Then we can make our assertion and\nverify that our conditions are verified to make our test pass (so, in this case, we can verify that our various method\non the various collaborators have/have not been called). We are done with our example. As you can see you can experiment\na little bit with expectations and implement complex patterns to verify your closure. You can find the complete example\ndiscussed\nabove [here](https://github.com/chicio/Asynchronous-Testing-Closure-Dependency \"asynchronous operation swift example\").\nExpectation: your true friend for asynchronous code testing :heart:.\n","slug":"/2018/06/01/async-closure-test-mock-expectation-fulfill/","description":"In this post I will talk about asynchronous testing in Swift.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]},"f26d6bc1-d0b4-500e-ab6f-05cf5700f3b3":{"title":"Spring Boot + Kotlin Rest client cheatsheet: RestTemplate and Webclient","content":"\n*During the last months I worked a lot with Spring Boot backend applications. In this post I explain how you can consume\na REST api from a Spring Boot application using RestTemplate and (the new) WebClient.*\n\n---\n\nIn the last few months I started to work as a backend developer during my daily job (and (for now) I\ndo [mobile/web frontend development only in my spare time](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor \"ID3TagEditor\")). The\nbackend applications I'm working on use Spring Boot as application framework. Let's start from a definition of what are\nSpring and Spring Boot:\n\n> The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.\n\n> Spring Boot is Spring's convention-over-configuration solution for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can \"just run\".[22] It is preconfigured with the Spring team's \"opinionated view\" of the best configuration and use of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.\n\nSo as you can understand from the definition above these frameworks speed up the development by giving some production\nready tools/configurations/setup out of the box. As you read from the descriptions above these are frameworks from the\nJava world. In fact all the code I wrote is in one of these two languages: Java and Kotlin. In particular, all the new\nstuff I developed in the last month has been written in Kotlin. For those who don't know, Kotlin is\n\n> ...is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference made by JetBrains. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[3] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise...\n\nIf you ever developed something in Swift, with Kotlin you will feel at home :heart_eyes: (we will talk about this topic\nin another post :smirk:).  \nAs a consequence of the fact that we live in the [\"Microservices era\"](https://microservices.io \"microservices\"), one of\nthe most common operation that I do in my code is consume a REST api of one microservice from another one. How can you\ndo that in a Spring Boot application? There are two main component that we can use: RestTemplate and WebClient. Let's\nsee how they works by developing a small Spring Boot application that call an external service and will return the\nresult of this call through an endpoint.\n\n#### The application\n\nThe application I create is very simple. It (obviously) use Spring Boot as application framework, Gradle as build system\nand Kotlin as main language (I'm using also Kotlin DSL instead of Groovy for the gradle file depedencies definition).\nThe application contains a single controller called `SpringBootRestClientsCheatsheetsApi` that exposes two simple api:\n\n* `\"/clients/rest-template/command/{restTemplateCommand}\"`\n* `\"/clients/webclient/command/{webClientCommand}\"`\n\nThese two api internally invoke various endpoint of an external \"Tattoo archive\" fake API: the first one\nusing `RestTemplateService`, a class that use `RestTemplate` as REST client, the second one using `WebClientService`, a\nclass that uses `WebClient` as REST client. Let's see some code starting from the gradle file. In it you can see all the\nSpring Boot dependencies. In particular I'm using the new `spring-boot-starter-webflux` that contains both client,\nbecause as we will see later `WebClient` as been recently added to the framework (starting from the new Spring 5.0\nReactive).\n\n```kotlin\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile\n\nplugins {\n\tid(\"org.springframework.boot\") version \"2.4.1\"\n\tid(\"io.spring.dependency-management\") version \"1.0.10.RELEASE\"\n\tkotlin(\"jvm\") version \"1.4.21\"\n\tkotlin(\"plugin.spring\") version \"1.4.21\"\n}\n\ngroup = \"it.chicio\"\nversion = \"0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\"\njava.sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11\n\nrepositories {\n\tmavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n\timplementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux\")\n\timplementation(\"org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect\")\n\timplementation(\"org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8\")\n\timplementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web\")\n\timplementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator\")\n\timplementation(\"com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin:2.11.+\")\n\ttestImplementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test\")\n}\n\ntasks.withType<KotlinCompile> {\n\tkotlinOptions {\n\t\tfreeCompilerArgs = listOf(\"-Xjsr305=strict\")\n\t\tjvmTarget = \"11\"\n\t}\n}\n\ntasks.withType<Test> {\n\tuseJUnitPlatform()\n}\n```\n\nNow let's see the `SpringBootRestClientsCheatsheetsApi` controller. It is a standard `RestController`. As you can see\nthe two services classes are passed as dependecies at construction time using Spring Dependency Injection. The methods\nparse the request command received and based on its value they call one of the external fake endpoints using one of the\nservice classes.\n\n```kotlin\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"clients\")\nclass SpringBootRestClientsCheatsheetsApi(\n        private val restTemplateService: RestTemplateService,\n        private val webClientService: WebClientService\n) {\n    @GetMapping(\"/rest-template/command/{restTemplateCommand}\")\n    fun commandRestTemplate(\n        @PathVariable restTemplateCommand: RestTemplateCommand\n    ): ResponseEntity<String> = ResponseEntity.ok(when (restTemplateCommand) {\n        RestTemplateCommand.GetForEntity -> restTemplateService.getForEntity()\n        RestTemplateCommand.GetForObject -> restTemplateService.getForObject()\n        RestTemplateCommand.PostForEntity -> restTemplateService.postForEntity()\n        RestTemplateCommand.PostForObject -> restTemplateService.postForObject()\n        RestTemplateCommand.Put -> restTemplateService.put()\n        RestTemplateCommand.Delete -> restTemplateService.delete()\n        RestTemplateCommand.Exchange -> restTemplateService.exchange()\n    }.toString())\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/webclient/command/{webClientCommand}\")\n    fun command(\n        @PathVariable webClientCommand: WebClientCommand\n    ): ResponseEntity<String> = ResponseEntity.ok(when (webClientCommand) {\n        WebClientCommand.GetSynchronous -> webClientService.getSynchronous()\n        WebClientCommand.GetAsynchronous -> webClientService.getAsynchronous().block()\n        WebClientCommand.PostSynchronous -> webClientService.postSynchronous()\n        WebClientCommand.PostAsynchronous -> webClientService.postAsynchronous().block()\n        WebClientCommand.PutSynchronous -> webClientService.putSynchronous()\n        WebClientCommand.DeleteSynchronous -> webClientService.deleteSynchronous()\n        WebClientCommand.Exchange -> webClientService.exchange().block()\n    }.toString())\n}\n```\n\nThe two service classes are created in a standard Spring Configuration with their respective REST clients. These\nservices use a `TattooServiceConfiguration` class to get the base url for the external fake api.\n\n```kotlin\n@Configuration\nclass SpringBootRestClientsCheatsheetsConfiguration {\n    @Bean\n    fun restTemplate(): RestTemplate = ...\n\n    @Bean\n    fun restTemplateService(\n            restTemplate: RestTemplate,\n            tattooServiceConfiguration: TattooServiceConfiguration\n    ): RestTemplateService = RestTemplateService(tattooServiceConfiguration, restTemplate)\n\n    @Bean\n    fun webClient(): WebClient = ...\n\n    @Bean\n    fun webClientService(\n            webClient: WebClient,\n            tattooServiceConfiguration: TattooServiceConfiguration\n    ): WebClientService = WebClientService(tattooServiceConfiguration, webClient)\n}\n```\n\n```kotlin\n@Configuration\n@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"tattooservice\")\nclass TattooServiceConfiguration {\n    var url: String = \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThe external fake Tattoo archive API is composed of four endpoints:\n\n* one GET tattoo API\n* one POST tattoo API\n* one PUT tattoo API\n* one DELETE tattoo API\n\nI omitted the PATCH verb because I don't use it very often. To interact with these API I created some classes that are\nneeded as request or response object in these calls. Below you can find them. One important thing to note: as a\nconsequence of the fact that all these are `data` classes I had to add `jackson-module-kotlin` as dependency in order to\nmake Jackson (a suite of data-processing and serialization tools used internally by Spring) work with Kotlin `data`\nclasses. See `implementation(\"com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin:2.11.+\")` dependecy in the gradle file\nabove.\n\n```kotlin\n@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)\ndata class Tattoo(\n    var id: Long,\n    var title: String,\n    var dimensions: Dimensions,\n    var style: TattooStyles\n)\n\nenum class TattooStyles {\n    NewSchool,\n    OldSchool,\n    Tribal,\n    Japanese\n}\n\ndata class Dimensions (\n    val height: Long,\n    val width: Long\n)\n\ndata class TattooPostResult (\n    val result: String\n)\n```\n\nThe external fake API are served using the standalone version of [WireMock](http://wiremock.org \"wiremock\"), a Java mock\nserver.\n\n#### RestTemplate\n\n`RestTemplate` is the standard way to consume APIs in a synchronous way. Even if it has been deprecated starting from\nSpring 5.0 in favour of `WebClient`, it is still widely used. The standard way to create a `RestTemplate` instance is by\nusing the `RestTemplateBuilder` class. During the creation it is possible to customize some parameters, like for example\nthe connection timeout.\n\n```kotlin\n@Bean\nfun restTemplate(): RestTemplate = RestTemplateBuilder()\n        .setConnectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n        .build()\n```\n\nNow we are ready to call the external APIs. Let's start from the GET one. We can use one of these methods:\n\n* `getForEntity`, a method that will return a `ResponseEntity` that contains as body the content of the API response but\n  also other useful information (e.g. Headers, HTTP status code)\n* `getForObject`, a method thaty will return directly the content of the API response without any other information\n\nBoth these methods will return the content deserialized into the Kotlin `Tattoo` class we saw above. If the server\nreturn a 4xx or 5xx status code RestTemplate will throw a `RestClientResponseException` that we can catch to do some\nfallback operations. We can construct the url to be called using the `UriComponentsBuilder`. These class will be used\nfor all the code snippet below.\n\n```kotlin\nfun getForEntity(): ResponseEntity<Tattoo> = try {\n    restTemplate.getForEntity(\n            UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri(),\n            Tattoo::class.java\n    )\n} catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n    ResponseEntity.status(e.rawStatusCode).build()\n}\nfun getForObject(): Tattoo? = try {\n    restTemplate.getForObject(\n            UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri(),\n            Tattoo::class.java\n    )\n} catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n    null\n}\n```\n\nThe POST external api can be called with two similar methods:\n\n* `postForEntity`, again, a method that will return a `ResponseEntity`\n* `postForObject`, as above, a method that will return directly the content of the API response\n\nIn this case we have to pass a body in the request of the call. These can be done by passing an instance of the class\nthat represents the body content. Jackson will do all the hard work :heart_eyes:.\n\n```kotlin\nfun postForEntity(): ResponseEntity<TattooPostResult> = try {\n    restTemplate.postForEntity(\n            UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri(),\n            Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool),\n            TattooPostResult::class.java\n    )\n} catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n    ResponseEntity.status(e.rawStatusCode).build()\n}\nfun postForObject(): TattooPostResult? = try {\n    restTemplate.postForObject(\n            UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri(),\n            Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool),\n            TattooPostResult::class.java\n    )\n} catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n    null\n}\n```\n\nNext is the PUT api. These can be called by using the `put` method. In this case there's no return body (because put\ndoesn't accept it as standard) so there's only one implementation method for these HTTP verb.\n\n```kotlin\n    fun put(): String = try {\n        val tattoo = Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool)\n        restTemplate.put(\n                UriComponentsBuilder\n                        .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                        .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                        .build()\n                        .toUri(),\n                tattoo,\n        )\n        \"Tattoo resource created $tattoo\"\n    } catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n        val error = \"Put client error ${e.rawStatusCode}\"\n        logger.error(error)\n        error\n    }\n```\n\nThen we have the DELETE api. Again, also here we have just one implementation.\n\n```kotlin\nfun delete(): String = try {\n    restTemplate.delete(\n            UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri()\n    )\n    \"Tattoo resource deleted\"\n} catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n    val error = \"Put client error ${e.rawStatusCode}\"\n    logger.error(error)\n    error\n}\n```\n\nLast but not least we have an additional `exchange` method. This `RestTemplate` method let you can API with different\nHTTP verbs by specifing it in the parameter list. There are various override of this method that take into account all\nthe parameters required by the different HTTP verbs (e.g. POST body request). In the example below I try to call again\nthe POST API.\n\n```kotlin\nfun exchange(): ResponseEntity<TattooPostResult> = try {\n    restTemplate.exchange(\n            UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri(),\n            HttpMethod.POST,\n            HttpEntity<Tattoo>(Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool)),\n            TattooPostResult::class.java\n    )\n} catch (e: RestClientResponseException) {\n    ResponseEntity.status(e.rawStatusCode).build()\n}\n```\n\n#### WebClient\n\n`WebClient` is the new REST client starting from Spring 5.0 Reactive. In the long term it will substitute `RestTemplate`\n. The key feature of these new client is that it can do asynchronous non blocking calls that published reactive `Mono`\nor `Flux` streams. The caller can subscribe to these streams and react to them. Anyway you can still also do synchronous\nblocking calls. Let's start from the creation by using the `WebClient.builder()`. Also in these case I customized the\nconnection timeout.\n\n```kotlin\n@Bean\nfun webClient(): WebClient = WebClient.builder()\n        .clientConnector(ReactorClientHttpConnector(HttpClient.from(TcpClient\n                .create()\n                .option(ChannelOption.CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, 10000)\n                .doOnConnected { connection: Connection ->\n                    connection.addHandlerLast(ReadTimeoutHandler(10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))\n                    connection.addHandlerLast(WriteTimeoutHandler(10000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))\n                })))\n        .build()  \n```\n\nNow I was ready to call again the APIs we saw before. To call them there's just one `retrieve` method. To call the\ndifferent HTTP verbs I just had to customized the request with the correct method:\n\n* `get()`, for GET\n* `post()`, for POST\n* `delete()`, for DELETE\n* `put()`, for PUT\n\nIf the API returns an error we receive an event on the `onStatus` response callback and we can do some fallback\noperations. As we said in the introduction `WebClient` can do synchronous and asynchrouns calls. How?\n\n* If we want to do a synchronous call, we can instruct the `WebClient` to convert to a `ResponseEntity` the result of\n  the API call with the `toEntity` method and then call the `block()` method to immediately subscribe and block\n  indefinitely the call (so until timeout or until we receive a response)\n* If we want to do a asynchronous call, we can instruct the `WebClient` to convert to `Mono` the result of the API call\n  with the `bodyToMono` method.\n\nBelow you can find the synchronous and asynchrounous versions of the API calls.\n\n```kotlin\nfun getSynchronous(): ResponseEntity<Tattoo>? = webClient\n        .get()\n        .uri(UriComponentsBuilder\n                .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                .build()\n                .toUri())\n        .retrieve()\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"4XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is5xxServerError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"5XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .toEntity(Tattoo::class.java)\n        .block()\n\nfun getAsynchronous(): Mono<Tattoo> = webClient\n        .get()\n        .uri(UriComponentsBuilder\n                .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                .build()\n                .toUri())\n        .retrieve()\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"4XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is5xxServerError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"5XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .bodyToMono(Tattoo::class.java)\n\nfun postSynchronous(): ResponseEntity<TattooPostResult>? = webClient\n        .post()\n        .uri(UriComponentsBuilder\n                .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                .build()\n                .toUri())\n        .body(BodyInserters.fromValue(Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool)))\n        .retrieve()\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"4XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is5xxServerError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"5XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .toEntity(TattooPostResult::class.java)\n        .block()\n\nfun postAsynchronous(): Mono<TattooPostResult> = webClient\n        .post()\n        .uri(UriComponentsBuilder\n                .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                .build()\n                .toUri())\n        .body(BodyInserters.fromValue(Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool)))\n        .retrieve()\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"4XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .onStatus(HttpStatus::is5xxServerError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"5XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n        .bodyToMono(TattooPostResult::class.java)\n\nfun putSynchronous(): String {\n    val tattoo = Tattoo(123, \"A new beautiful tattoo\", Dimensions(100, 40), TattooStyles.NewSchool)\n    webClient\n            .put()\n            .uri(UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri())\n            .body(BodyInserters.fromValue(tattoo))\n            .retrieve()\n            .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"4XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n            .onStatus(HttpStatus::is5xxServerError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"5XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n            .bodyToMono(Void::class.java)\n            .block()\n    return \"Tattoo resource created $tattoo\"\n}\n\nfun deleteSynchronous(): String {\n    webClient\n            .delete()\n            .uri(UriComponentsBuilder\n                    .fromHttpUrl(tattooServiceConfiguration.url)\n                    .path(\"/tattoo/123\")\n                    .build()\n                    .toUri())\n            .retrieve()\n            .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"4XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n            .onStatus(HttpStatus::is5xxServerError) { Mono.error(RuntimeException(\"5XX Error ${it.statusCode()}\")) }\n            .bodyToMono(Void::class.java)\n            .block()\n    return \"Tattoo resource deleted\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nYou can find the complete source code of the application described above in\nthis [github repository](https://github.com/chicio/SpringBoot-RestClients-Cheatsheets \"spring boot resttemplate webclient cheatsheet\")\n.  \nThe last months were really challenging.

We can have our first React Native\ncomponent live inside our app by just following\nthe [getting started tutorial for existing app](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps/ \"getting started tutorial for existing app\"). \nWhat happen if we need to use multiple react native component in different parts of our existing apps :fearful:?\nIn this tutorial I will show you how we can use multiple instances of `RCTRootView` to show different React Native\ncomponents in different parts of your app. Consider, for example, a simple iOS existing app with React Native. It has\ntwo very simple React Native components:\n\n* `BlueScreen`, that shows a blue view\n* `RedScreen`, that shows a red view\n\n```jsx\nclass BlueScreen extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.blue} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass RedScreen extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.red} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  blue: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#0000FF\",\n    width: \"100%\",\n    height: \"100%\"\n  },\n  red: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#FF0000\",\n    width: \"100%\",\n    height: \"100%\"\n  }\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BlueScreen', () => BlueScreen);\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('RedScreen', () => RedScreen);\n```\n\nOn the native side there's a controller, `ReactViewController`, that shows a React Native component given its name.\n\n```swift\nclass ReactViewController: UIViewController {\n    init(moduleName: String) {\n        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n        view = RCTRootView(bundleURL: URL(string: \"http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios\"),\n                           moduleName: moduleName,\n                           initialProperties: nil,\n                           launchOptions: nil)\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere's also another controller, `MainViewController`, that shows the React Native components described above using\nmultiple instances of the `ReactViewController`. The UI of the app is very simple: there are two buttons on the view of\nthe `MainViewController`. A tap on the first one shows the `ReactViewController` with a `RCTRootView` that contains\nthe `RedComponent`. A tap on the second one shows the `ReactViewController` with a `RCTRootView` that contains\nthe `BlueComponent`.  \nThis basically means that in this app there are multiple `RCTRootView`, one for each controller created. This instances\nare kept alive at the same time (because the `MainViewController` keeps a reference to the two `ReactViewController`).\nThe code to start the React Native components is the same contained in\nthe [getting started tutorial for existing app](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps/ \"getting started tutorial for existing app\")\n.\n\n```swift\nclass MainViewController: UIViewController {\n    private let blueViewController: ReactViewController\n    private let redViewController: ReactViewController\n\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        blueViewController = ReactViewController(moduleName: \"BlueScreen\")\n        redViewController = ReactViewController(moduleName: \"RedScreen\")\n        super.init(coder: aDecoder)\n    }\n\n    @IBAction func showRedScreen(_ sender: Any) {\n        navigationController?.pushViewController(redViewController, animated: true)\n    }\n\n    @IBAction func showBlueScreen(_ sender: Any) {\n        navigationController?.pushViewController(blueViewController, animated: true)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf we try to run the app something very strange will happen:\n\n* if we do a live reload, we will see our **React components refreshed multiple times**\n* if we press cmd + ctrl + z (shake gesture simulation) in the simulator **2 dev menu will be shown**\n\n`youtube: https://youtu.be/HgSbUVlv1Oo`\n\n* if we do a **live reload while we're in debug mode the app could crash**\n\n![The react native app crashes if we try to do a live reload](../images/posts/react-native-crash-reload-with-debugger.jpg)\n\nWhat's happening here? Well, there's something wrong in our code. If we take a look at the comments in the code of React\nNative for the `RCTRootView` initializer, we will notice something very strange:\n\n```objective_c\n/**\n * - Designated initializer -\n */\n- (instancetype)initWithBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge\n                    moduleName:(NSString *)moduleName\n             initialProperties:(NSDictionary *)initialProperties NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER;\n\n/**\n * - Convenience initializer -\n * A bridge will be created internally.\n * This initializer is intended to be used when the app has a single RCTRootView,\n * otherwise create an `RCTBridge` and pass it in via `initWithBridge:moduleName:`\n * to all the instances.\n */\n- (instancetype)initWithBundleURL:(NSURL *)bundleURL\n                       moduleName:(NSString *)moduleName\n                initialProperties:(NSDictionary *)initialProperties\n                    launchOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions;\n```\n\nWhat :laughing:?????!?!?!??? This basically means that the documentation in the getting started is considering only the\ncase where we will have a single `RCTRootView` instance. So we need to do something to our `ReactViewController` so that\nwe can keep multiple `RCTRootView` alive at the same time. The solution to our problem is contained in the comments of\nthe initializer above: we need to use the designated `RCTRootView` initializer to start to use multiple instances of\nthem at the same time in the app. So the new `ReactViewController` with the new `RCTRootView` initialization is the\nfollowing one:\n\n```swift\nclass ReactViewController: UIViewController {\n\n    init(moduleName: String, bridge: RCTBridge) {\n        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n        view = RCTRootView(bridge: bridge,\n                           moduleName: moduleName,\n                           initialProperties: nil)\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhere do we get an instance of `RCTBridge` for the new init of the `ReactViewController` and `RCTRootView`? A new\nobject, `ReactNativeBridge`, creates a new `RCTBridge` instance and store it as a property.  \nThe `RCTBridge` instance needs a `RCTBridgeDelegate`. Another new object, `ReactNativeBridgeDelegate`, will be the\ndelegate of the `RCTBridge`.\n\n```swift\nclass ReactNativeBridge {\n    let bridge: RCTBridge\n\n    init() {\n        bridge = RCTBridge(delegate: ReactNativeBridgeDelegate(), launchOptions: nil)\n    }\n}\n\nclass ReactNativeBridgeDelegate: NSObject, RCTBridgeDelegate {\n\n    func sourceURL(for bridge: RCTBridge!) -> URL! {\n        return URL(string: \"http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow it is possible to modify the `MainViewController`. This controller will create a single `ReactNativeBridge` with a\nsingle `RCTBridge` instance. This instance will be passed to the two `ReactViewController`. So they will basically share\nthe same bridge instance.\n\n```swift\nclass MainViewController: UIViewController {\n    private let blueViewController: ReactViewController\n    private let redViewController: ReactViewController\n    private let reactNativeBridge: ReactNativeBridge\n\n    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {\n        reactNativeBridge = ReactNativeBridge()\n        blueViewController = ReactViewController(moduleName: \"BlueScreen\",\n                                                 bridge: reactNativeBridge.bridge)\n        redViewController = ReactViewController(moduleName: \"RedScreen\",\n                                                bridge: reactNativeBridge.bridge)\n        super.init(coder: aDecoder)\n    }\n\n    @IBAction func showRedScreen(_ sender: Any) {\n        navigationController?.pushViewController(redViewController, animated: true)\n    }\n\n    @IBAction func showBlueScreen(_ sender: Any) {\n        navigationController?.pushViewController(blueViewController, animated: true)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow if we try to run the app again everything will work as expected:\n\n* if we do a live reload, we will see our **React components refreshed just one time**\n* if we press cmd + ctrl + z in the simulator **1 dev menu will be shown**\n* **no more crashes with live reload in debug mode**\n\n`youtube: https://youtu.be/z2gwLX8LaLQ`\n\nThe entire source code of the app used as example for this post is contained in [this github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Multiple-RCTRootView \"React native multiple RCTRootView\").\nNow we're ready to use multiple React Native components at the same time in our app :relieved:.\n","slug":"/2017/12/08/react-native-multiple-instance-rctrootview/","description":"In this post I show you how it is possible to use multiple RCTRootView instances in an existing iOS app.","authors":["fabrizio-duroni"]}}}}
