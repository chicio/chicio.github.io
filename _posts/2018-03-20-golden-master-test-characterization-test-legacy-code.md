*In this post I will talk about golden master test aka characterization test: what it is and how to use it.*

---

In the last few months the focus during my daily job was not only on mobile. I had the chance to work on some front-end 
and back-end application of [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ "lastminute.com group"). In 
particular, I worked with my team to renew the customer area of all the main brands sites: [volagratis
.com](https://www.volagratis.com/ "volagratis"), [lastminute.com](https://www.it.lastminute.com/ "lastminute") and 
[rumbo.es](https://www.rumbo.es/ "rumbo"). 
During the last week I did pair programming with [Emanuele Ianni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanueleianni/ "Emanuele Ianni"). 
Emanuele is a senior full-stack software engineer and a true nerd :alien:/computer science lover :heart:.
 We needed to implement a new feature for a family of microservices (based on Java 1.8 and Spring Boot) that make up 
 the back-end of the customer area, both for web and mobile apps of [lastminute.com group](https://lmgroup.lastminute.com/ "lastminute.com group").
 Unfortunately, we found some legacy code without tests, exactly where we planned to add the feature. At
  this moment Emanuele showed me the Golden master testing technique.
 Soooo what is golden master testing? As always (and maybe you can expect it because you are a huge fan of my blog 
 and you read all my previous posts :laughing:) Wikipedia gives us all the answer we need:
 
 > In computer programming, a **characterization test (also known as Golden Master Testing)** is a means to describe 
 (characterize) the actual behavior of an existing piece of software, and therefore protect existing behavior of 
 legacy code against unintended changes via automated testing. This term was coined by **Michael Feathers**...... When 
 creating a characterization test, one must observe what outputs occur for a given set of inputs. Given an 
 observation that the legacy code gives a certain output based on given inputs, then a test can be written that 
 asserts that the output of the legacy code matches the observed result for the given inputs.
 
 So Golden master testing, mostly know as characterization test, is a technique by which we can be able to put 
 large and complex legacy code under test: we generated some output given some input for a piece of code, and we 
 write tests in which we assert that the output from the source code must be the same we received before. In this way
  we can start to refactor a piece of code and be sure that our modifications didn't change the behaviour of the 
  source code. Whooaaa!! No more risky approaches to do refactoring without tests!!! :relieved: :clap:  
  Now it's time for an example. In this article I will show you a simple example where I apply this technique to put 
  under test a piece of legacy code. You can find the entire source code in [this github repository](https://github.com/chicio/Golden-Master-Testing-Characterization-Test "Golden Master Testing Characterization Test repo").
  Suppose for example that you found this class, `TravelsAdapter`, in the code you're working on.
  
```java
public class TravelsAdapter {
    public List<Travel> adapt(JsonNode jsonNode) throws InvalidTravelException {
        List<Travel> travels = new ArrayList<>();
        JsonNode payloadNode = jsonNode.with("data");
        if (payloadNode.findValue("orderId") == null || 
                StringUtils.isBlank(payloadNode.findValue("orderId").textValue())) {
            throw new InvalidTravelException("Invalid order id");
        }
        long orderId = payloadNode.findValue("orderId").asLong();
        JsonNode flights = payloadNode.withArray("flights");
        if (flights.size() == 0) {
            throw new InvalidTravelException("Invalid json (no flights)");
        }
        flights.iterator().forEachRemaining(flight -> {
            ObjectNode nodeFlight = (ObjectNode) flight;
            if (nodeFlight.get("flightId") == null || StringUtils.isBlank(nodeFlight.get("flightId").textValue())) {
                try {
                    throw new InvalidTravelException("Invalid flightNumber value");
                } catch (InvalidTravelException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            String flightNumber = nodeFlight.get("flightId").textValue();
            String arrivalAirport = nodeFlight.get("to").textValue();
            String departureAirport = nodeFlight.get("from").textValue();
            String airline = nodeFlight.get("airline").textValue();
            travels.add(new Travel(
                            orderId,
                            flight.toString(),
                            flightNumber,
                            airline,
                            departureAirport,
                            arrivalAirport));
        });
        return travels;
    }
}
```  

It's really a mess. So we start to think "I want to see the tests of this class to understand what it 
does", but we search for them in the project and......there aren't any tests for this class!!! :fearful:. The logic 
contained in this class seems a little bit twisted, and also it would take a lot of time to write a complete suite of
 test case because we need to understand from the beginning every single path contained in this class. This is a case
  where golden master testing could help us.  
  The first thing we can do is to observe the method returns a list of `Travel` objects. To write our golden master 
  tests we need to find a way to do a comparison between the `Travel` objects returned from the `adapt` method and 
  the one we expect. To do this we can add for example a `toString` method the `Travel` class and test the returned 
  value from it. So the `Travel` class will be the following one.
  
```java
public class Travel {
    private final long orderId;
    private final String flights;
    private final String flightId;
    private final String airline;
    private final String departureAirport;
    private final String arrivalAirport;

    Travel(long orderId,
           String flights,
           String flightId,
           String airline,
           String departureAirport,
           String arrivalAirport) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.flights = flights;
        this.flightId = flightId;
        this.airline = airline;
        this.departureAirport = departureAirport;
        this.arrivalAirport = arrivalAirport;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Travel{" +
                    "orderId=" + orderId + ", " +
                    "flights='" + flights + '\'' + ", " +
                    "flightId='" + flightId + '\'' + ", " +
                    "airline='" + airline + '\'' + ", " +
                    "departureAirport='" + departureAirport + '\'' + ", " +
                    "arrivalAirport='" + arrivalAirport + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}
``` 

Now we can write some tests and use the output as the expectation. In this way we will be sure that if we start to do
 some refactoring operation on this class our modification didn't broken any behaviour of the class. So we can do our
  refactoring with an high level of confidence that everything is working as it was working before our modification :relieved:.
To get the output for the test, you can write your test and made them fails, and in the meanwhile log the result so 
that we can copy it and use it in the next run iteration of our test. The following test is the one we generated for 
the class we saw before.

```java
public class TravelsAdapterTest {

    @Test
    public void goldenMaster() throws IOException, InvalidTravelException {
        TravelsAdapter travelsAdapter = new TravelsAdapter();

        List<Travel> travels = travelsAdapter.adapt(generateRequest());

        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        travels.forEach(bp -> {
            builder.append(bp.toString());
            builder.append("\n");
        });
        assertThat(
                builder.toString(),
                is("Travel{" +
                            "orderId=0, " +
                            "flights='{" +

                "            ]\n" +
                "        }\n" +
                "      }\n" +
                "    ]\n" +
                "  }\n" +
                "}"
        );
    }
}
```
   
In this example we generated just one test case, but usually a lot more of them. Basically we can apply a technique 
named **"property testing"**: a lot of random input are generated so that there will be an high probability to 
execute all the possible branch in our source code (and in this way have a higher test coverage).    
So we put our `TravelsAdapter` under test and we can now start to work on this class without any kind of risk 
:relieved:. Now it's time to test this technique in your legacy code :grin:.
