without using react-native link command*.

What is React Native? It is one of the most successful and loved mobile development framework. It let you build *real native 
mobile* application using Javascript. It has been developed by Facebook. Let's see the definition from the official 
website: 

>Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React. React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. 
 It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, 
 you don't build a “mobile web app”, an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app”. You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable 
 from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular 
 iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

Cool :sunglasses:!!!! Isn't it? Write an app using Javascript with the same performance of native code. You can also 
reuse your native component and bridge them to the javascript side.  
Most of the time the React Native framework will help you also to manage dependencies inside you project. But sometimes, especially 
if your project doesn't follow the standard React Native directories structure you can have some problem when you try 
to link you external library.  
While I was working on an [existing native app integrated with React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html 'existing native app integrated with React Native') that 
has a custom directories structure for the react-native and native code, I found some problem to add [Realm](https://realm.io 'https://realm.io'), the famous open source dbms, as a dependency to the project.  
In this post I will show you an example of how you can add Realm to your app that has a custom React Native 
installation. Let's start :cold_sweat:!!
To describe the installation process I will use a sample app I created for this post called `ReactNativeRealmManualLink`. You can find 
it with realm installed in [this github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Realm-Manual-Link 'React Native realm manual link').   
Suppose you have a project like the one I shared above, in which React Native is contained in a subfolder of the iOS 
project, instead of the other way around in a standard React Native installation. 

![React Native realm directories](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-1-directories.jpg "React Native realm directories")

First, to add realm as a dependency we need to install it through npm with following command.

```shell
npm install --save realm
``` 

Then we try to link the library to the native code with the standard React Native command.

```shell
react-native link realm
```

But here something strange happens: as you can see from the screenshot below the command fails to link the library. 
So we need to find another way to install the library.

![React Native realm link fails](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-2-link-fails.jpg "React Native realm directories")

Usually, if the previous command fails, you have to do the [manual linking](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html "manual linking"). 
To do it we navigate inside the `node_modules` folder, contained in the React Native folder of our project, to found the realm folder. 
Inside it you will find an Xcode project named `RealmReact`, that you have to drag into our project. After that we 
have to add a reference to 
the static library `libRealmReact` and compile the project.

![React Native realm manual link step 1](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-3-manual-link-step-1.jpg "React Native realm manual link")
![React Native realm manual link step 2](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-3-manual-link-step-2.jpg "React Native realm manual link")

Now you would expect that everything works fine but...

![React Native realm manual link fails](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-4-manual-link-fails.jpg "React Native realm manual link fails")

What's happening? The `RealmReact` project is expecting the React Native headers in a relative position with respect 
to its original position. Arrrgghhh :rage:!! We need to find another way...  

What can we do? We can start by observing that the `RealmReact` project is just a "container project" for:
 * `RealmJS` project, that  generates two static libraries `libRealmJS.a` and `libGCDWebServers.a`
 * an Objective-C++ class `RealmReact`
 * an Objective-C++ file `RealmAnalytics`  
 
So we can try to modify our main project by:
 * adding the `RealmJS` project and the Objective-C++ files/classes as references
 * linking the static libraries `libRealmJS.a` and `libGCDWebServers.a` to our main project and see if everything works

![React Native realm custom manual link step 1](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-5-custom-manual-link-step-1.jpg "React Native realm custom manual link step 1")
![React Native realm custom manual link step 2](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-5-custom-manual-link-step-2.jpg "React Native realm custom manual link step 1")

Now we need to add to the `Header search path` option of our main project the paths that were setted in the `RealmReact` project. In this way 
the `RealmJS` project will be able to find some headers it needs. You can find the complete list of the folder that 
we need to add in the screenshot below.

Now if we try to compile our app we expect that everything works fine but...ERROR :warning::fire:!!! The build fails :boom:!!! 

![React Native realm C++ error](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-7-Cplusplus-error.jpg "React Native realm C++ error")

It seems like that in order to be able to compile the C++ source code contained in `RealmJS` we need to set a recent C++ version 
in our project setting that supports some new features like auto return type on static function. We can set it to C++ 14 
and set the Standard Library to the LLVM one with C++ 11 support.

![React Native realm C++ setup](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-8-Cplusplus-setup.jpg "React Native realm C++ setup")

One final step is to remove the flag `-all_load` from the `Other linker flag` option of the main project (if you have it). 
In this way we avoid to load all Objective-C symbols and have the "duplicated symbols" error.

![React Native realm all_load flag](/assets/images/posts/react-native-realm-9-all_load.jpg "React Native realm all_load flag")   
 
We are now ready to build our app and see if everything works. To do this we create a sample native view controller 
that has a `RCTRootView` 

```swift
class ReactNativeRealmController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        let jsCodeLocation = URL(string: "http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios")
        view = RCTRootView(
            bundleURL: jsCodeLocation,
            moduleName: "ReactNativeRealmScreen",
            initialProperties: nil,
            launchOptions: nil
        )
    }
}
```

and a sample react component with some realm write/read operations.

```jsx
const Realm = require('realm');

class ReactNativeRealmScreen extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            realm: null
        };±
    }

    componentWillMount() {
        Realm.open({
            schema: [{name: 'Band', properties: {name: 'string', singer: 'string'}}]
        }).then(realm => {
            realm.write(() => {
                realm.create('Band', {name: 'HIM', singer: 'Ville Valo'});
            });
            this.setState({ realm });
        });
    }

    render() {
        const message = this.state.realm
            ? 'The singer of HIM band is: ' + this.state.realm.objects('Band').filtered('name = "HIM"')[0].singer
            : 'Loading...';

        return (
            <View style={styles.container}>
              <Text>
                  {message}
              </Text>
            </View>
        );
    }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    }
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('ReactNativeRealmScreen', () => ReactNativeRealmScreen, false);
```

We are now ready to build our app and, as expected, everything works fine.

That's it!! As I told you before you can find the complete example in [this github repo](https://github.com/chicio/React-Native-Realm-Manual-Link 'React Native realm manual link'). 
We are now ready to create our React Native component with realm :bowtie:.
