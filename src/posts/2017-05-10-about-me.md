*It's me, Fabrizio Duroni. A software developer with a true passion for his work. A computer graphics lover. But wait,
another blog yet? Yes, you're right, it could be boring. I hope this will not be my case.*

Hello! I'm Fabrizio Duroni. I live in Como, Italy with my family, my girlfriend Chiara and a lot of computers. I started
to love technology since I was 7 years old, when I received my
first [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "Game Boy") for Christmas. I still remember the first day I
played to [Super Mario Land 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land_2:_6_Golden_Coins "Super Mario Land 2").
It was really amazing.

favourite game")

I continued my journey with another console,
the [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System "Nintendo NES"). Just to be clear (if you
didn't get it yet), video games are one of main hobbies. After the first two Nintendo console, I became a Playstation
Fan and I bought every console Sony has been release since the first one in 1995.  
I bought my first pc when I was 10 years old. It was equipped with an AMD K5 (NO INTEL PENTIUM?!!! :open_mouth:)
processor and 64 MB of RAM. I remember the first experiments with it and how fun it was to discover new things about
computer science every day.  
I started to study programming since I was 14. I started with Pascal during High School and then I continued with **C,
Java, PHP** during my bachelor's degree. In 2009 I fell in love with Apple :iphone: (what??!!!! :laughing:), and I
started to develop iOS application in 2010. As a result you can understand why I'm in love with **Swift** and **
Objective-C**. This was also the time when started my *internal struggle* about which one is the best between Apple and
Microsoft, without forgetting, of course, of Linux (and I don't think this internal fight will never end :sweat_smile:).

In 2013 I started my master degree, where I studied in **computer graphics**, the computer science field I love the
most. This is why I also fell in love with **C++**. I also know **Javascript** and **TypeScript**.  
If you want to read other details about my computer science journey, see my [homepage](/ "homepage").  
I consider myself an experienced developer. I enjoy so much my work. I consider it as a way to challenge myself every
day and it also gives me the possibility to get in touch with a lot of very smart people.

### **By the way, what does it mean Chicio?**

Chicio is my nickname as long as I could remember. Everyone is used to call me in this way. Sometimes I think this is my
real name. Its origin will remain unknown (to you... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:), but I really like it.

### **Why do you want to start a blog?**

Just for selfish reasons. Mainly because I want to keep track of my progress in programming, computer graphics and
generally speaking in everything related to computer science. That's it.

### **What is the logo image near the blog name?**

It's an image of the [Sombrero Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_Galaxy "Sombrero galaxy"). You can find an
image of this galaxy also on the cover
of [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://cleancoders.com "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship")
by Robert C. Martin "Uncle Bob". I'm getting deep into the clean code world while I'm starting this blog and I think I
will talk a lot also about this topic.

### **Is there something after Computer Science?**

Obviously Chiara, the most important person in my life :cupid:.  
There was a time when I was a huge metal :metal: and rock music fan. I tried to play bass guitar for some years, but I
failed miserably (really, it's not my job :grin:). In fact, I have on my skin "the signatures" (tattoos!!) from that
period. Now I enjoy a more "open relation" with music without too much stress (but I eventually hope in the near future
to start again to make some signatures on my skin :relieved:). I also really like to go with my bicycle. I could say I'm
some sort of sportsman.

The presentation is over, and I hope you're not already bored.  
Enjoy the read.
