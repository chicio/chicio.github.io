*SwiftUI has been introduced by Apple during the last WWDC. I started to use it for a personal project to understand its
potential. Let's see how I used SwiftUI to create a custom TabBar with modal and detail navigation.*

**NB.: Considering the success of this blog post, I decided to create a new custom TabBar SwiftUI library called [TabBarUIAction](https://github.com/chicio/TabBarUIAction "TabBArUIAction custom tab bar swiftui"). Go and check it out!!!**

In the last week I started to develop a new personal project: a new iOS mobile app (that I will show you in the following months). 
As a consequence of the fact that this was a greenfield project I decided to use SwiftUI to develop all the User 
Interface and Combine for data binging. These frameworks are the Apple implementation of reactive programming 
(combine) and declarative user interface programming (SwiftUI). In this post we will focus on SwiftUI (we will see 
combine in another post later :wink:). Even if it is still not ready for a complete production product because
[a lot of UIKit part are missing and you have to expose them manually](https://goshdarnswiftui.com/#framework-integration-uikit-in-swiftui) 
and because some stuff doesn't work as expected, SwiftUI is a big step forward with respect to the old imperative 
UIKit approach (sometimes I still have headache about Autolayout issues and constraint definition :astonished::smile:).  
In this post I will show you how I created a custom tab bar with the ability to open a modal from a tab bar item 
(like some major apps, e.g. Instagram) and a customized navigation where the TabBar is shown only on the first level 
of navigation. Below you can find a video that shows the final result.

#### Implementation

Let's start by defining and enum that will identify our tabs in a more expressive way. In the custom tab bar there will
be three element, but only two are real tabs (as you see from the video above the one in the middle is modal).

```swift
enum Tab {
    case Tab1
    case Tab2
}
```

The main view `MainView` contains 2 variable fields:

* `currentView`, a `@State` variable that keeps the current tab selected
* `showModal`, a `@State` variable that is used to manage the presentation of the modal from the central button of the
  TabBar

The `body` of the view is composed by a `NavigationView` that contains a `VStack` with main components of the custom tab
bar implementation:

* `CurrentScreen`, that contains and show the current screen selected
* `TabBar`, that contains custom tab bar with all its logic

There are also some style customization like forcing the `navigationViewStyle` to `StackNavigationViewStyle`, in order
to avoid to see a blank screen on iPad (because the `NavigationView` on iPad is a split view by default :laughing:).
Last but not least, there is a `sheet` defined to show a `ScreenModal` view as a modal whenever the state
variable `showModal` changes and the property `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)` on the `VStack` to avoid movement of the
tabbar when the current screen needs to show the keyboard.

```swift
struct MainView: View {
    @State private var currentView: Tab = .Tab1
    @State private var showModal: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                CurrentScreen(currentView: self.$currentView)
                TabBar(currentView: self.$currentView, showModal: self.$showModal)
            }
            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
        }
        .background(Color(.white))
        .navigationViewStyle(StackNavigationViewStyle())
        .sheet(isPresented: self.$showModal) { ScreenModal() }
    }
}
```

Let's see first the implementation of the `CurrentView`. This view is really simple: it shows a specific screen based on
the value of its `currentView`. As you may already noticed, `currentView` is a not a state variable. It is annotated
with the property wrapper `@Binding`. What does it mean? The `@Binding` property wrapper lets us declare that one value
actually comes from elsewhere, and should be shared in both places. This basically means that this variable will be
updated as soon as the variable passed at construction time for this view will be update, and the view will be update
consequently by changing the screen shown.

```swift
struct CurrentScreen: View {
    @Binding var currentView: Tab

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if self.currentView == .Tab1 {
                Screen1()
            } else {
                Screen2()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Let's see the `TabBar` implementation. Also this view contains two `@Binding` variables:

* The first one is again `currentView`, that will be updated by its children `TabBaItem`  views whenever the user will
  tap on them.
* The other one is `showModal`, that is a boolean modified by the `ShowModalTabBarItem` with the method `toggle()`, that
  invert the current value of the boolean. As you remember we defined a state variable `showModal` in the `MainView`. So
  as soon as the user taps on `ShowModalTabBarItem` the `showModal` state is modified and the `MainView` will show a
  modal screen `ScreenModal`.  
  Beautiful!! :heart_eyes:

```swift
struct TabBar: View {
    @Binding var currentView: Tab
    @Binding var showModal: Bool

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            TabBarItem(currentView: self.$currentView, imageName: "list.bullet", paddingEdges: .leading, tab: .Tab1)
            Spacer()
            ShowModalTabBarItem(radius: 55) { self.showModal.toggle() }
            Spacer()
            TabBarItem(currentView: self.$currentView, imageName: "gear", paddingEdges: .trailing, tab: .Tab2)
        }
        .frame(minHeight: 70)
    }
}
```

The implementation of `TabBarItem` is simple. It contains the styling for the tab bar item. The important thing to
notice is here is the `onTapGesture` modifier. Whenever a user taps on it the `@Binding currentView`  variable will be
updated and so also the `@State` variable `currentView` in the `MainView` and consequently also the `CurrentScreen` view
will be update.

```swift
struct TabBarItem: View {
    @Binding var currentView: Tab
    let imageName: String
    let paddingEdges: Edge.Set
    let tab: Tab

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing:0) {
            Image(systemName: imageName)
                .resizable()
                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                .padding(5)
                .frame(width: 40, height: 40, alignment: .center)
                .background(Color(self.currentView == tab ? .blue : .white).opacity(0.2))
                .foregroundColor(Color(self.currentView == tab ? .blue : .black))
                .cornerRadius(6)
        }
        .frame(width: 100, height: 50)
        .onTapGesture { self.currentView = self.tab }
        .padding(paddingEdges, 15)
    }
}
```

The `ShowModalTabBarItem` is also simple. It contains the style for the custom TabBar item and it attach the action to
show the modal to the view with the `onTapGestureModifier`.

```swift
public struct ShowModalTabBarItem: View {
    let radius: CGFloat
    let action: () -> Void

    public init(radius: CGFloat, action: @escaping () -> Void) {
        self.radius = radius
        self.action = action
    }

    public var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing:0) {
            Image(systemName: "plus.circle.fill")
                .resizable()
                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                .frame(width: radius, height: radius, alignment: .center)
                .foregroundColor(Color(.systemBlue))
                .background(Color(.white))
                .cornerRadius(radius/2)
                .overlay(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: radius/2).stroke(Color(.blue), lineWidth: 2))

        }
        .frame(width: radius, height: radius)
        .onTapGesture(perform: action)
    }
}
```

`Screen1`, `Screen2` and `ScreenModal` are full screen `VStack` view that defined the content for each screen. The
important part is the definition of the title on `Screen1` and `Screen2` to modify the navigation bar using
the `navigationBarTitle` modifier. In the `Screen1` view there's also a `NavigationLink` that let us navigate to a
detail/second level screen. As you remember in the `MainView` we defined a `NavigationView` as container of the custom
TabBar with the current content. This let us keep the TabBar only on the first level of navigation and it when the user
enters in the details screen.

```swift
struct Screen1: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            HStack {
                Spacer()
                Text("Screen 1")
                    .font(.system(size: 20))
                    .bold()
                Spacer()
            }
            HStack {
                NavigationLink(destination: ScreenDetail()) { Text("Show detail") }
            }
            Spacer()
        }
        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)
        .background(Color(.yellow).opacity(0.2))
        .navigationBarTitle("Screen 1")
    }
}

//...

struct Screen2: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            HStack {
                Spacer()
                Text("Screen 2")
                    .font(.system(size: 20))
                    .bold()
                Spacer()
            }
            Spacer()
        }
        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)
        .background(Color(.purple).opacity(0.2))
        .navigationBarTitle("Screen 2")
    }
}

//...

struct ScreenModal: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            HStack {
                Spacer()
                Text("Screen 2")
                Spacer()
            }
            Spacer()
        }
        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .topLeading)
        .background(Color(.red).opacity(0.2))
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
    }
}

```

#### Conclusion

You can find all the code shown in this
post [in this Github repo](https://github.com/chicio/SwiftUI-CustomTabBar "custom tab bar swiftui"). Apple has done a
great job with SwiftUI and I hope that the framework will receive in the future updates all the missing UIKit pieces (
while still missing a [lot of stuff on the web/Safari side](/2019/03/03/github-pages-progressive-web-app/)). If you
already used powerful declarative framework like React or React Native you will feel at home (seems like a copy of each
other :blush:). Stay tuned for other post about SwiftUI and Combine soon. :heart:.
