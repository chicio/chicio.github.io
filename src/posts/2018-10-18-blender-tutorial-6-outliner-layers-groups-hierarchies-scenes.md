*In this new post of the series Blender tutorial I will talk about outliner, layers, groups, hierarchies and scenes.*

In the [previous post of the series "Blender tutorial"](/2018/08/21/blender-tutorial-5-advanced-modeling/) we talked
about advanced modeling in Blender. In this post we will continue to explore the capabilities of Blender by analyzing
outliner, layers, groups, hierarchies and scenes.  
Let's start from the **outliner**. This one contains the complete list of the objects contained in the scene. Each on of
them is represented with its material and geometry. It is possible to rename a mesh by *right clicking* on it and
choosing *rename*. To the right of each mesh we have the *restriction column*. It contains 3 buttons:

* *the first button let us hide meshes in the 3D window*
* *the second button let us set a mesh as not selectable*
* *the third button let us hide meshes from the final renderer*

Now let's talk about **layers**. We can find the layer panel at the bottom of the 3D window. Each layer is represented
with a button similar to a checkbox. We can turn on/off a layer by clicking on their corresponding button. We can add a
mesh to a specific layer by selecting the layer and creating the mesh we want (primitive or import it). We can also move
layer by using the *m key* shortcut or by using the menu *Object -> Move to layer*.

Another way to organize our objects is by using **groups**. With groups you can select multiple objects at once. We can
create groups and add an object to an existing group by using the menu in the property panel or by using the *ctrl + g
keys* shortcut.

After layers and group we have **scenes**. Scenes allow us to create different set of our objects or new set with new
object inside our project. We can create and manage scenes by using the outliner and the ad hoc menu at the top of the
3D window. We can create scenes that:

* are linked together: this means that a modification to one mesh in a scenes will be reflected also in the other.
* separated scene: this means that a modification to one mesh in a scenes will NOT be reflected also in the other.

Last but not least we have **hierarchies**. We can create hierarchies of objects by selecting them and by choosing *
Object ->  Parent*. Here we can find all the possible type of parental relationships that we can create. After creating
a hierarchies of objects, they will be shown grouped in the outliner. We will use hierarchies extensively when we will
talk about animation.

In the next post we will talk about materials.
